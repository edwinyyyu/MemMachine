    - Verifying that runtime configuration changes have been applied

    Resources may be in one of three states:

    be used by the memory systems.

    Both `episodic_memory` and `semantic_memory` are optional. Supply one

    1. Add a new resource via `POST /config/resources/embedders` or
       `POST /config/resources/language_models`
    2. Call this endpoint to point the memory configuration at the new resource
    3. The configuration is persisted to the configuration file
