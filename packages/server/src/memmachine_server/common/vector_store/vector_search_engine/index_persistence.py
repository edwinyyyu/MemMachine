"""
Atomic on-disk index publication, shared by vector search engines.

The index is written to a sibling temp file, flushed, and swapped into place
with ``os.replace``. Because the flush completes before the rename is issued,
a crash leaves either the previous index or the new one -- never the new name
over incomplete bytes, which is the case that matters: the vector store treats
a saved-but-unloadable index as a hard error, while an index that reverts is
only missing vectors until they are upserted again.

The rename itself is not made durable -- that needs an fsync on a directory
fd, which POSIX offers unevenly and Windows not at all -- so a power failure
can still roll a save back to the previously published index after ``save``
returned, while the SQLite side stays committed. Records applied since the
last checkpoint then resolve by uuid but cannot be found by search. That is
the direction this store tolerates; #1588 records why.

Why a rename at all: the stronger answer is to put the commit point inside the
file, where an fsync reaches it portably. SQLite never renames -- it commits by
truncating or zeroing its rollback journal, and in WAL mode by appending frames
whose checksums make a torn tail self-identifying, so recovery keeps everything
up to the last frame that verifies. Both need the writer to own the file
format. A search engine owns its own and exposes ``save(path)``, so above that
call a rename is the only atomicity primitive left. An engine whose format
already commits that way needs none of this.

    Fsync the index bytes, on a descriptor that predates them.

    This is what rules out publishing the new name over incomplete bytes: the
    data is durable before the rename is issued, and a durable write does not
    un-happen. A failed fsync therefore fails the save -- the caller discards
    the temp and the previously published index stands -- because a failure
    here is exactly the evidence that the bytes are not safe to publish.

    The descriptor has to predate the write for that to hold. Flushing would
    work on one opened afterwards, since dirty pages belong to the file rather
    than to the descriptor that dirtied them, but error reporting would not:
    Linux samples the writeback error sequence when a file is opened, so a
    descriptor opened after an error was recorded never learns of it and the
    fsync returns success over bytes already known bad.

    Holding a descriptor across someone else's write assumes they write in
    place. An engine that wrote a file of its own and renamed it over this one
    would leave this descriptor on an orphaned inode, and the fsync would
    report on a file nobody is about to publish -- so that is checked rather
    than assumed.
