## Overview

When you ingest data into the memory engine, the server returns an `AddMemoryResult`. This contains the unique identifiers for the newly created memory entries, which can be used for later retrieval or specific updates.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `results` | `{ uid: string }[]` | An array of objects, each containing the unique `uid` of an added memory entry. |

## Usage Example

```typescript
const result = await client.addEpisodicMemory(memoryData);

// Log the ID of the first added memory
if (result.results.length > 0) {
  console.log(`Memory saved with ID: ${result.results[0].uid}`);
}
```
