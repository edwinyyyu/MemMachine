The MemMachine TypeScript SDK is built for modern AI workflows, providing a type-safe, metadata-driven interface to the MemMachine memory engine. 

## Active Entry Point

The latest version of the SDK leverages a unified client structure. Instead of managing multiple class instances, you perform all memory operations through the `MemMachineClient` using **Metadata Scoping**.

  The active class for all Episodic and Profile memory operations. Recommended for 100% of new integrations.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    ```bash
    npm install @memmachine/sdk
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize & Use">
    Supply your `org_id` and `project_id` within the metadata context of your calls to maintain isolation.

    ```typescript
    import { MemMachineClient } from '@memmachine/client';

    const client = new MemMachineClient({ api_key: 'your_api_key' });

    // Scoped operation using Context
    await client.addEpisodicMemory({
      content: "User likes high-contrast UI.",
      metadata: { org_id: "org_1", project_id: "proj_A", user_id: "user_1" }
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
