"""v22-listfaith RewriteSegmenter -- production v22 prompt + LIST FAITHFULNESS rule.

Hypothesis
----------

The LIST FAITHFULNESS rule added to v22-fp-min v1->v2 lifted g4 cat1 by
+6.46pp empirically. The mechanism is model-level: LLMs default to
compressing enumerable items into vague phrases (``various``, ``several``,
a partial sample) regardless of voice (1p vs 3p) or prompt structure
(minimalist vs full v22).

Transfer hypothesis: adding the same rule, unconditional form, to the
full production v22 prompt should also lift cat1 retrieval, since v22's
``Preserves every CONCRETE PARTICULAR`` clause is general and does not
specifically forbid list-compression.

v22-listfaith
-------------

Identical to PROMPT_REWRITE_V22 except for one additional bullet inserted
into the EACH STATEMENT list (placed adjacent to the concrete-particular
preservation bullet, where the model is already attending to verbatim
preservation). No new examples; the rule alone is the intervention.

Everything else (RewriteContext + dual-text embed, SurroundingEventsContext,
KEEP/DROP enumeration, one-event-per-statement, speech-act-only-when-event,
date resolution discipline) is unchanged from production v22.

PROMPT_REWRITE_V22_LISTFAITH = """\
Rewrite the MESSAGE into a JSON list of standalone third-person \
memory statements. Each statement is stored verbatim and later \
retrieved by semantic search. A future user querying any specific \
content in the message should find at least one statement that \
contains that content.

KEEP what is specific to this message; DROP what is interchangeable \
across similar messages. Specific content includes: names of people, \
places, organizations, brands, named objects, named activities; \
dates, times, durations, quantities; identifiers, titles, quoted \
phrases, proper nouns; decisions, plans, preferences, opinions, \
relationships, roles, emotional states tied to events; described \
events (something that happened or will happen); attached-media \
descriptions. Interchangeable content has none of these -- bare \
greetings, sign-offs, acknowledgments, reactions, and questions \
whose phrasing introduces nothing from the specific list above. \
Dropping specific content is a FAILURE; emitting a statement for \
interchangeable content is a FAILURE.

EACH STATEMENT:
- Corresponds to one EVENT in the message, not to one sentence. An \
event is a single occurrence, decision, plan, observation, state, \
or preference at one point or span in time. A multi-sentence \
elaboration of the same event (subject in one sentence, reason in \
the next, outcome after that) is ONE statement that contains all of \
those sentences' particulars. Emitting one statement per sentence \
is a FAILURE; emitting one statement per concrete particular is a \
FAILURE; merging two distinct events into one statement is a \
FAILURE. Distinct events (different times, different occasions, \
different actions) each get their own statement, even when they \
share participants or topics.
- Contains every concrete particular the message gives about its \
event -- subject, action, time, place, attendees, motivation, \
outcome, attached media.
- Refers to the speaker by name. First-person self-references \
resolve to the speaker's name; second-person references resolve to \
the addressee's name when one is known; demonstrative and ambiguous \
pronouns resolve to their concrete referents. The first occurrence \
of any queryable entity is named; subsequent references within the \
same statement may use natural pronouns and possessives.
- Preserves every CONCRETE PARTICULAR from the message verbatim -- \
names, dates, numbers, identifiers, decisions, plans, preferences, \
opinions, relationships, emotional states tied to events, \
distinctive phrasing, attached-media descriptions. Generic \
abstractions or stock paraphrases for specifics are FAILURES.
- LIST FAITHFULNESS. When the raw message contains an enumeration \
(a list of three or more comparable items: names, books, places, \
foods, brands, hobbies, languages, dates, etc.), the statement MUST \
preserve EVERY listed item verbatim. Summaries that collapse the \
list into ``various``, ``several``, ``a few``, ``many``, ``some``, \
or a partial sample are FAILURES. If the list itself is the \
queryable content, the statement is a single enumeration -- not \
multiple statements. Two comma-separated phrases that describe the \
SAME event are not an enumeration; only three-or-more comparable \
items count.
- Preserves polarity, direction, and emotional tone. "Used to" \
implies no longer; "didn't get to bed until 2 AM" implies a late \
end, not a late start.
- Resolves every relative time reference into an absolute date or \
interval anchored at {date}: past-tense and backward markers go \
backward; future-tense and forward markers go forward; bare \
month/day references resolve to the nearest occurrence consistent \
with the surrounding tense; bare durations resolve to a span ending \
at {date}; bare shortcuts ("the weekend", "the holidays") resolve \
to the nearest past occurrence when no tense marker is present. \
The original relative phrase MUST NOT appear after resolution.
- Is anchored to the date of the event it describes -- {date} for \
events that happened during the message, or the resolved date for \
events that happened on a different date. One date per statement.
- Traces every detail back to words in the message. Inferred \
attributes (a title from context, a gender from a name, an age, an \
ethnicity, an unstated role) are FAILURES; explicitly stated \
attributes are preserved.
- Reports the content the message conveys, not the speech-act of \
conveying it. "X said that ...", "X told Y that ...", "X mentioned \
that ..." framing is included ONLY when the speech-act itself is \
the event (an apology, a promise, an explicit announcement).

NEIGHBORING TURNS appear before and after the message strictly to \
help resolve second-person addressees, demonstratives, anaphora, \
and unresolved relative references. Content drawn from the \
neighbors is NEVER emitted -- only content drawn from the message \
itself.

Output: a JSON object {{ "memories": [...] }}. The list is empty \
when the message contains no specific content.
