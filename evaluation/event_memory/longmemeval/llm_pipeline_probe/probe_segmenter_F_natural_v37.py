"""LLM segmenter, Mode F-natural v37 -- over-fragmentation fix (v3).

v33 (shipped) over-fragments LoCoMo conversational data (avg 2.8
segments/event vs baseline 1.0). v35 with explicit "prefer one"
bias + example reached 7-11/15 on F4 over-fragmentation cases.
v36 stripped bias and example, reverting to definition-only
("topic shift is a change in subject matter") -- regressed below
v33 (3/15). Suggests gentle clarifications don't move the model.

v37 = v33 + a rule 6 restructure. Reframes rule 6 around the
*unit* of segmentation: the topic, not the sentence. The framing
is structural rather than prescriptive -- it neither biases toward
fewer segments nor uses examples. Whether this moves the model
on gpt-5.4-nano @ low is the open question.

PROMPT_F_NATURAL_V37 = """\
Compress this passage into the parts a human would still want during \
memory reconstruction, broken into a list of standalone memory \
segments. These segments are stored verbatim and shown back when the \
memory is retrieved.

Rules:
1. VERBATIM. Each segment is a contiguous verbatim quote from the \
passage. Never paraphrase, swap synonyms, or change wording -- \
"fabulous" stays "fabulous"; preserve whitespace, newlines, and \
special characters within a segment exactly. The only edits allowed \
are starting and ending the quote at sentence or clause boundaries.
2. KEEP what is specific to this passage; DROP what is interchangeable \
across similar passages. Specific content differentiates this passage \
from any other -- names, places, dates, numbers, identifiers, \
decisions, plans, opinions, preferences, relationships, emotional \
states tied to events, constraints, distinctive phrasing. Multi-line \
non-prose blocks (code, tables, ASCII art, diagrams, encoded text) \
are also specific -- keep each as one segment; dropping such a block \
as decoration is a FAILURE. Interchangeable content has none of \
these specifics -- it is pure framing that could open or close any \
passage regardless of subject (e.g., bare greetings, sign-offs).
3. SHORT RESPONSES that are only meaningful with the prior message \
("yes", "no", "ok", "got it", "sounds good", "acknowledged") are \
KEPT -- they carry the answer or reaction the reconstructed memory \
needs to show.
4. An utterance that begins with a greeting or softener but carries \
substantive content is KEPT -- drop only the leading greeting, not \
the content.
5. PRESERVE original order -- segments appear in the same order as \
their source quotes.
6. SEGMENT BY TOPIC, NOT BY SENTENCE. The unit of segmentation is \
the topic. A segment spans every consecutive sentence that develops \
the same topic, and ends only when the passage moves to a different \
topic. Coherence trumps balance: a topic developed across many \
sentences is one segment; several topics in a row are several \
segments, one per topic. Do not artificially split a coherent unit, \
and do not artificially merge unrelated ones.
7. STANDALONE -- each segment reads on its own. If a quote depends on \
a referent introduced earlier ("the trip" for "the Tokyo trip in \
May"), widen the quote to start where the referent is named.

Output: a JSON object {{ "segments": [...] }} and nothing else.
