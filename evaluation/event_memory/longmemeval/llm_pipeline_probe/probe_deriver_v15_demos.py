"""v15 deriver probe — few-shot demonstrations.

Fresh seed (parallel to v14 goal-first). Instead of teaching the model
the task via principles, show it 5 input/output examples spanning the case
distribution. The hypothesis: examples are more model-agnostic than rules.

Examples use neutral names and unrelated domains so the prompt doesn't
overfit to test-case shape (per memory feedback_prompt_examples_generic):
  - Pat, Riley, Casey, Jordan, Avery
  - puppy, mandolin, book club, climbing, cookbook

5 demonstrations chosen to span:
  E1. Focused single fact (one near-original)
  E2. Multi-fact narrative with shared scope (split + scope propagation)
  E3. Multi-sentence single-subject (anti-atomization compression)
  E4. Non-prose: code (description)
  E5. Acronym-dense (include both forms)

The task instruction is minimal — examples carry the load.

A SEGMENT is stored verbatim. Produce DERIVATIVES — strings that get \
embedded into a semantic search index alongside it, designed to match \
future user queries about the segment.

Here are 5 examples showing the segments and their ideal derivatives.

EXAMPLE 1 (focused single fact):
SEGMENT: I tried the mandolin lesson yesterday and loved it.
DERIVATIVES: ["I tried the mandolin lesson yesterday and loved it."]

EXAMPLE 2 (multiple independent facts under a shared scope):
SEGMENT: On the trip to Patagonia I summited Cerro Torre with Riley, stayed at the Estancia Cristina lodge for 4 nights at $300/night, and ate lamb asado in El Chaltén.
DERIVATIVES: [
  "On my trip to Patagonia I summited Cerro Torre with Riley.",
  "On my trip to Patagonia I stayed at the Estancia Cristina lodge for 4 nights at $300/night.",
  "On my trip to Patagonia I ate lamb asado in El Chaltén."
]

EXAMPLE 3 (multi-sentence single-subject — compress, don't atomize):
SEGMENT: Pat's puppy is a golden retriever named Mochi. She loves chewing on shoes and chasing squirrels in the backyard. Pat adopted her last month from the local shelter and is still housebreaking her.
DERIVATIVES: [
  "Pat's puppy Mochi is a golden retriever who loves chewing on shoes and chasing squirrels in the backyard.",
  "Pat adopted Mochi last month from the local shelter and is still housebreaking her."
]

EXAMPLE 4 (non-prose code: describe in prose):
SEGMENT:
def reverse_words(s):
    return " ".join(s.split()[::-1])
DERIVATIVES: [
  "Python function reverse_words that takes a string and returns it with its space-separated words in reversed order."
]

EXAMPLE 5 (heavy acronyms — include both forms in one derivative):
SEGMENT: Casey said the CFO of ACME announced a 30% YoY revenue bump at the AGM.
DERIVATIVES: [
  "Casey said the CFO (Chief Financial Officer) of ACME announced a 30% YoY (year-over-year) revenue bump at the AGM (Annual General Meeting)."
]

Now produce derivatives for the segment below, following the same \
pattern. Output a JSON object {{ "derivatives": [...] }} and nothing else.

        seized up from a decade of moisture, so we ended up rebuilding the \
        289 V8 from scratch, with new pistons, rings, and a Holley \
        four-barrel carburetor. Bodywork was the worst part — the rear \
        quarter panels were so corroded we had to fabricate replacements \
        from sheet metal at a friend's shop in Poughkeepsie. We went with \
        the original Wimbledon White over a black interior, which was the \
        color my grandfather always said he wanted but never got around \
        to repainting. The chrome trim was sent out to a specialty \
        re-plater in Pennsylvania. We rebuilt the suspension with new \
        bushings, replaced the rear leaf springs, and put in a Borg-Warner \
        T-10 four-speed transmission to match the original spec. Last \
        weekend I finally drove it down to the Hudson Valley cars-and-coffee \
        and parked it next to my friend Marcus's '69 Camaro. It still pulls \
        slightly to the right under hard braking and the radio is a modern \
