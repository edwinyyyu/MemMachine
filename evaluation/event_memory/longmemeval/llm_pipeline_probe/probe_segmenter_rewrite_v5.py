"""LLM rewriting segmenter v5 — mem0-style observation-date anchoring.

User constraints:
  1. Better than text-seg at SAME K (currently win K=8 +1.7pp, lose K=40
     -0.7pp, lose K=160 -1.3pp). High-K loss concentrated on
     open-domain (-8pp at K=160).
  2. Better than mem0 at SAME TOKENS (currently lose ~5pp full bench
     at low-token k=10 budget).

Both goals require getting more answer-relevant info per segment.

v5 hypothesis: removing rule 6 (NO REDUNDANT DATE PREFIX) and instead
encouraging observation-date inclusion inside prose:
  - matches mem0's V3 architecture (every memory carries the date)
  - gives more retrieval surfaces for date-aware queries
  - gives the answerer LLM temporal grounding co-located with the fact
  - costs ~5-10% more tokens per segment (acceptable trade if it lifts
    scores)

Tradeoff: removes rule 6's token-saving optimization. If it doesn't
help scores at the same K, it just costs tokens for nothing.

Change from v2: rule 6 inverted from "NO REDUNDANT DATE PREFIX" to
"INCLUDE OBSERVATION DATE WHEN DATING THE EVENT". Rule 5 (time
resolution) still applies for embedded relative phrases.

PROMPT_REWRITE_V5 = """\
Rewrite a single conversational message into a JSON list of \
self-contained third-person memory statements. The memory system \
stores these statements and later retrieves them by semantic search; \
each statement must be findable and meaningful on its own.

CONTEXT:
- The message was spoken by {speaker} on {date}.
- You only see this one message. Do not reference what came before \
or after.

RULES:
1. THIRD PERSON. Use the speaker's name in place of first-person \
references ("I" -> "{speaker}"). Use a descriptive name in place of \
second-person references when the addressee is not known to you \
("you" -> "the other party"). Replace ambiguous pronouns with their \
concrete referents.

2. SELF-CONTAINED. A statement must be understandable in isolation, \
without the surrounding conversation. State who is involved, what \
happened or what is being claimed, and any time, location, or \
quantity that grounds the statement.

3. PRESERVE EVERY SPECIFIC. Names, dates, numbers, quantities, titles, \
brands, places, named objects, named activities, quoted phrases, and \
proper nouns must appear in the statement exactly as written in the \
message. Replacing a specific with a vague category is a failure: \
"Ferrari 488 GTB" stays "Ferrari 488 GTB" (not "a car"); \
"promoted to assistant manager" stays "assistant manager" (not \
"manager"); "416 pages" stays "416 pages" (not "about 400 pages"); \
"watched 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'" keeps the full \
title.

4. PRESERVE MEANING. Mirror the exact direction, polarity, and \
emotional content of the original. "Used to enjoy X" means no longer \
enjoys X. "Didn't get to bed until 2 AM" means LATE BEDTIME, not late \
wakeup. "Can't stop X-ing" means doing X frequently. Emotional states \
("scared but reassured", "happy and thankful"), motivations \
("inspired by her own journey"), and subjective descriptions \
("therapeutic", "nerve-wracking") are part of the meaning and stay.

5. TIME RESOLUTION. Convert every relative time reference into an \
absolute date or interval, using {date} as the anchor.
   - Past-tense markers ("yesterday", "last week", "ago", verbs in \
past tense, "used to") resolve BACKWARD from {date}.
   - Future-tense markers ("tomorrow", "next week", "upcoming", \
"will", "expecting", "this coming", verbs in future tense) resolve \
FORWARD from {date}.
   - Ambiguous bare month/day references ("in March", "on the 5th") \
resolve to the nearest occurrence consistent with the surrounding \
tense -- backward for past tense, forward for future tense.
   - Absolute dates and explicit durations stay verbatim -- "18 days" \
stays "18 days".
   - After resolution, the original relative phrase MUST NOT appear \
in the statement. Replace "yesterday" with the resolved date; do not \
keep "yesterday" alongside the date.

6. DATE-ANCHOR EACH STATEMENT. Every statement should be anchored to \
a specific date drawn from the message context. When the statement \
describes an event, action, observation, or claim made on the \
observation date {date}, include "{date}" in the statement (e.g., \
"On {date}, {speaker} said ..." or "{speaker} attended X on \
{date}"). When the statement is about an event that happened on a \
different date (already in the message or resolved per rule 5), use \
that date instead. The date may appear once per statement and should \
sit naturally inside the prose, not as a redundant prefix.

7. ONE TOPIC PER STATEMENT. If the message covers multiple unrelated \
topics, produce one statement per topic. If a single topic carries \
several details (e.g. "I got promoted at Shopify last week after two \
years"), capture them together in one rich statement.

8. NO FABRICATION. Every detail in a statement must trace back to \
words in the message. Do not infer attributes (gender, age, \
ethnicity, role) from names or context. Do not import information \
from outside the message.

9. NO META-COMMENTARY. Extract the CONTENT of what was said, not the \
fact that it was said. "{speaker} asked about X" is wrong unless the \
question itself carries an incidental fact. If the message contains \
incidental personal facts inside a question or request, extract \
those facts.

10. DROP PURE FILLER. Greetings ("Hi"), sign-offs ("Bye"), and bare \
acknowledgments ("Sounds good", "Thanks", "Got it") that carry no \
specifics produce no statement. A message whose every part is \
interchangeable filler -- no name, date, number, decision, plan, \
preference, opinion, event, or attached media description -- emits \
an empty list.

11. NO DUPLICATES. Do not emit two statements that carry the same \
information in different words. Each fact appears exactly once.

Output: a JSON object {{ "memories": [...] }} where memories is a \
list of strings. Empty list if the message has no extractable \
specifics.
