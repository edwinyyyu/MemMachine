"""v9 deriver probe — segmenter-style tight format.

Target: ~3000 chars (40% shorter than v8's 5045, 70% shorter than v5's 9937).

Style match with PROMPT_F_NATURAL (1572 chars):
  - One-line context-setter, jump straight to "Rules:" enumeration.
  - Each rule 1-2 sentences max. No "principle" framing, no explanations.
  - No defensive fences ("do NOT do X, do NOT do Y...") — state the rule once.
  - Output line at end matching segmenter format.

Consolidations vs v8:
  - Rule 1 absorbs P9 (quoted speech).
  - "Query-shaped prose" rule dropped (rule 3's "near-original derivative"
    and rule 4's "no clones" cover it implicitly).
  - "First-person preserved" line dropped (caused F2 "I play" insertion).
  - "Rule 6 does NOT override rules 3/4" deference clause dropped (the
    "if rule 3 splits" conditional already enforces this).

PROMPT_DERIVER = """\
Produce DERIVATIVES of a SEGMENT for a semantic retrieval index. The \
SEGMENT is shown verbatim to the reader; your DERIVATIVES are the strings \
that get embedded. A derivative succeeds when it shares vocabulary and \
meaning with the query a future user would write to find this segment.

Rules:
  1. VERBATIM TOKENS. Named entities, places, brands, products, works, \
dates, amounts, distinctive concept words, technical terms, identifiers, \
and quoted speech (with attribution) appear verbatim in any derivative \
that covers them. Never invent content the segment lacks.
  2. COUNT CENTRAL SUBJECTS, NOT SENTENCES. If most clauses share one \
central subject (one product, place, person, project, process, event), \
yield 1–3 derivatives total — not one per sentence. \"X is P. X is Q. X \
has R.\" collapses to ONE. Co-mentioned entities (a city, a friend, a \
component brand) are attributes of that subject, not new subjects.
  3. ATOMIC FACTS GET ONE DERIVATIVE EACH. For genuinely independent \
facts (different central subjects), emit one self-contained derivative \
per fact. For a FOCUSED segment (one clause or one topical scope — a \
commit message, a chess move, a definition), emit EXACTLY ONE \
near-original derivative and STOP. Do not paraphrase the predicate, \
re-order, add \"the speaker said X\" wrappers, or split the topic. For a \
bare standalone term, emit just that term.
  4. NO NEAR-CLONES. Before finalizing, compare every pair: if both would \
match the same query, drop one. Items differing only by an id+value \
(versions of one model, rows of one set) collapse to ONE derivative \
naming the parent and listing items inline. Original-form + expanded-form \
(acronyms, translations) belong in ONE derivative, not two.
  5. CARRY SCOPE WHEN SPLITTING. If rule 3 splits into multiple \
derivatives, repeat shared scoping context (the trip, project, period, \
person, artifact the facts are ABOUT) in every sibling whose fact lives \
under that scope. Co-actors and per-clause attributes do not propagate.
  6. REPLACE NON-PROSE SURFACES. For encoded text, code, tables, lists \
of raw numbers, log lines, or markup: decode recognizable encodings \
(cipher, base64); emit at least one ARTIFACT-DESCRIPTION derivative \
naming what the segment IS (e.g., \"Python function\", \"benchmark \
table\") and what it is ABOUT; for multi-row tables, optionally emit one \
prose derivative per row when each is independently answerable. Render \
values in prose — never keep pipes, code syntax, or brackets.
  7. BRIDGE FORM GAPS. When likely query tokens differ from segment \
tokens (heavy acronyms like JFK/POTUS/CMC, or text in a different \
script/language than queries will use), emit a derivative including the \
expanded/translated form alongside the original. Skip for plain English \
with full names.

Output: a JSON object {{ \"derivatives\": [...] }} and nothing else.

        289 V8 from scratch, with new pistons, rings, and a Holley \
        four-barrel carburetor. Bodywork was the worst part — the rear \

        color my grandfather always said he wanted but never got around \
        to repainting. The chrome trim was sent out to a specialty \
        re-plater in Pennsylvania. We rebuilt the suspension with new \
        bushings, replaced the rear leaf springs, and put in a Borg-Warner \
        T-10 four-speed transmission to match the original spec. Last \
        weekend I finally drove it down to the Hudson Valley cars-and-coffee \
