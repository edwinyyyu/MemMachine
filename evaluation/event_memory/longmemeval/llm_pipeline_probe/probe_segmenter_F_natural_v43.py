"""LLM segmenter, Mode F-natural v43 -- referential-chain continuity.

Hypothesis: an objective signal of topic continuity is referential
chains. Two sentences belong to one segment if they share a focal
entity -- referenced by name, pronoun, definite description, or
deixis. A topic shift requires the referential chain to break.

This is operationally well-defined (referential chains are a standard
discourse-analysis primitive) and doesn't depend on the model's
intuition about "topic." No outcome bias, no example.

PROMPT_F_NATURAL_V43 = """\
Compress this passage into the parts a human would still want during \
memory reconstruction, broken into a list of standalone memory \
segments. These segments are stored verbatim and shown back when the \
memory is retrieved.

Rules:
1. VERBATIM. Each segment is a contiguous verbatim quote from the \
passage. Never paraphrase, swap synonyms, or change wording -- \
"fabulous" stays "fabulous"; preserve whitespace, newlines, and \
special characters within a segment exactly. The only edits allowed \
are starting and ending the quote at sentence or clause boundaries.
2. KEEP what is specific to this passage; DROP what is interchangeable \
across similar passages. Specific content differentiates this passage \
from any other -- names, places, dates, numbers, identifiers, \
decisions, plans, opinions, preferences, relationships, emotional \
states tied to events, constraints, distinctive phrasing. Multi-line \
non-prose blocks (code, tables, ASCII art, diagrams, encoded text) \
are also specific -- keep each as one segment; dropping such a block \
as decoration is a FAILURE. Interchangeable content has none of \
these specifics -- it is pure framing that could open or close any \
passage regardless of subject (e.g., bare greetings, sign-offs).
3. SHORT RESPONSES that are only meaningful with the prior message \
("yes", "no", "ok", "got it", "sounds good", "acknowledged") are \
KEPT -- they carry the answer or reaction the reconstructed memory \
needs to show.
4. An utterance that begins with a greeting or softener but carries \
substantive content is KEPT -- drop only the leading greeting, not \
the content.
5. PRESERVE original order -- segments appear in the same order as \
their source quotes.
6. SEGMENT BY REFERENTIAL CHAIN. Two consecutive sentences belong to \
the same segment when they share a focal entity or event -- whether \
named, pronominalized ("it", "they", "she"), referred to by definite \
description ("the X"), or referred to deictically ("this", "that"). \
A sub-aspect of the shared entity (its attributes, parts, \
consequences) counts as the same chain. Two consecutive sentences \
belong to different segments when the referential chain breaks: \
sentence B introduces a focal entity or event with no link to \
sentence A's chain, AND no chain-continuing reference (pronoun, \
definite, or deictic) bridges them. Discourse markers of explicit \
chain-break ("by the way", "anyway", "speaking of", "moving on") \
also mark a new segment.
7. STANDALONE -- each segment reads on its own. If a quote depends on \
a referent introduced earlier ("the trip" for "the Tokyo trip in \
May"), widen the quote to start where the referent is named.

Output: a JSON object {{ "segments": [...] }} and nothing else.
