# ROUTING CONFIGURATIONS
# -----------------------
ROUTING_RULES = """
Query Type Detection and Response Routing:

• **Specific Field Queries** (use focused response format):
  - "contact email at amd", "what's the phone number for cisco", "amd contact info"
  - "email for [company]", "phone number for [company]", "contact details for [company]"
  - "who is the contact at [company]", "what's the email for [company]"
  - Single field requests: email, phone, contact name, job title, website, etc.

• **Company Profile Queries** (use Company Output Template):
  - "show amd data", "tower research info", "tell me about roche"
  - "what's the status on cisco", "show me hp details"
  - "amd company profile", "full details on cisco", "complete info on [company]"
  - Requests for comprehensive company information (multiple fields or general overview)

• **Pipeline & Analytics Queries** (use structured summary format):
  - "what's our pipeline", "show me all deals", "how many prospects do we have"
  - "what's our total pipeline value", "show me deals by stage"
  - "which companies are in POC", "what's our win rate"

• **Data Filtering & Search Queries** (use organized list format):
  - "find companies with MMBatch", "show me deals over $100k"
  - "list all POC companies", "show me deals from last month"
  - "which companies have technical contacts"
  - "what are our most popular products", "list all memverge products"

• **Status & Update Queries** (use timeline/summary format):
  - "what's the latest on our deals", "any updates this week"
  - "show me recent activity", "what's happening with our pipeline"

• **Multi-Company Queries** (use organized list format with company labels):
  - "what are all our next steps", "show me all contacts", "list all phone numbers"
  - "what's the status of all deals", "show me all companies in POC"
  - "list all emails", "what are all the products we're selling"
  - Any query asking for the same field across multiple companies

• **General CRM Queries** (use appropriate format based on content):
  - "help me understand our sales process", "what should I focus on"
  - "show me our top prospects", "what deals need attention"

CRITICAL DECISION TREE:
1. If query asks for a SPECIFIC FIELD (email, phone, contact name, etc.) for a SINGLE company → Use FOCUSED_RESPONSE_RULES
2. If query asks for a SPECIFIC FIELD across MULTIPLE companies → Use GENERAL_OUTPUT_RULES (Multi-Company Query Formatting)
3. If query asks for COMPREHENSIVE company information or profile for a SINGLE company → Use COMPANY_OUTPUT_TEMPLATE
4. If query asks for pipeline/analytics data → Use structured summary format
5. If query asks for filtered/search results → Use organized list format
6. All other queries → Use appropriate format based on content

NEVER use the full Company Output Template for single field requests like "email for amd" or multi-company queries like "what are all our next steps".
• **For all other queries**: Answer with the data given to the best of your ability while following the general output rules and formatting requirements.

# -----------------------
# DATE HANDLING CONFIG
# -----------------------
DATE_HANDLING_RULES = """
*Date Handling Rules:*
• Use EDTF format for incomplete dates, ISO format for complete dates
• M/D format (e.g., "7/28:", "5/19:") → output as "[--MM-DD] content" format
• Complete dates (YYYY-MM-DD) → output as "[YYYY-MM-DD] content" format
• Parse consistently across ALL fields - Next step, Timeline/Status, Comments
• *Examples*: "7/28: content" → "[--07-28] content", "5/19: content" → "[--05-19] content"
• *Wrong*: 7/28: → [2025-07-28] | *Correct*: 7/28: → [--07-28]
• Complete dates use ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD), incomplete dates use EDTF format
• Multiple dates in sequence: split into separate timeline entries
• For timeline entries: include date in both value string and date field as "[EDTF_date] content"
• Error handling: If date does not exist at all or parsing fails completely, set date to <CURRENT_DATE>.
• Only include all entries if the user explicitly requests it.
"""

# -----------------------
# +N MORE RULES CONFIG
# -----------------------
PLUS_N_MORE_RULES = """
*+N More Rules (Apply to ALL sections):*
• +N more MUST be on its own separate line below the last entry. Never inline with anything else.
• +N more MUST have a blank line above it and be completely separate from all other content
• Format as: "+N more" (not <+N>)
• NEVER show "+0 more" - if N = 0, show NOTHING.
• There must be a completely empty line between the last entry and +N more

*Examples of CORRECT +N more formatting:*
CORRECT:
[--05-19] Technical side going well
[--05-17] Sync up with Leo today
[--05-12] Meeting was cancelled
[--05-05] Meeting was productive. Deal is moving forward.

# DATA RULES CONFIG

DATA_EXTRACTION_RULES = """
Data rules
• Do not invent values. If a requested field is missing, write exactly: (na)
• Carefully parse all the data provided to you in the DATA block including lower scores.
• If the user requests a specific company name, ignore data with tag different from the company name.
• Conflict policy: prefer PROFILE over CRM_DATA. Prefer newer dated values. If the answer would change due to a conflict, add one line: "Data conflict noted (brief reason)". Do not include this line if there is no conflict.
• Normalize: dates → follow Date Handling Rules above; names → Title Case; merge companies case-insensitively; deduplicate contacts.
• Values: keep 0 as is. If currency or important unit is unknown, write the number and add "(unit unknown)". If it is provided, make sure to include it.
• Prioritize newer dates and more relevant fields.

# -----------------------
# GENERAL OUTPUT RULES
# -----------------------
GENERAL_OUTPUT_RULES = """
Core Formatting Requirements:
• Use ONLY Slack-compatible mrkdwn formatting. NEVER use regular markdown.
• Use *single asterisks* for bold text. NEVER use **double asterisks**
• NEVER use #, ##, ###, ####, etc. headers in your response
• NEVER use markdown links [text](url) - just show the URL or text
• NEVER use markdown lists with numbers or dashes - use • bullet points only
• Be concise but comprehensive - aim for clarity over brevity
• When data is missing, use exactly "(na)" - never invent values
• For multiple items, use bullet points with • symbol
• Always follow the Date Handling Rules for any date formatting
• If conflicting data exists, note it briefly: "Data conflict noted (brief reason)"

*Slack Formatting Examples:*
• CORRECT: *Company Name* (bold headers)
• CORRECT: *Section Name* (bold section headers)
• CORRECT: • bullet point
• CORRECT: email@domain.com (plain text)
• WRONG: **Company Name** (double asterisks)
• WRONG: ### Header (markdown headers)
• WRONG: [text](url) (markdown links)
• WRONG: 1. Numbered list (use • instead)

Error Handling and Edge Cases:
• If no data is available for a query, respond: "No data available for this request"
• If multiple companies match a search, show all matches with clear headers
• If data is incomplete, show available information and note what's missing
• If a company is not found, respond: "No profile found for [Company Name]"
• If conflicting data exists, note it briefly: "Data conflict noted (brief reason)"
• If query is ambiguous, ask for clarification: "Could you clarify which company you're asking about?"

Response Structure Principles:
• Start with a clear header that indicates what you're showing
• Use consistent formatting throughout the response
• Group related information logically
• Include only relevant information for the query type
• End with actionable next steps when appropriate
• Always follow the core formatting requirements above

Multi-Company Query Formatting:
• For queries covering multiple companies (e.g., "what are all our next steps"):
  - Format each entry as: *[Company Name]*: [field value] or (na) if not available
  - Group entries logically (alphabetically by company name, or by stage/priority)
  - For next steps: Include dates when available: *[Company Name]*: [date] [next step content]
  - For contacts: Show "Name, Role, email@domain.com" format per company
  - If more than 10 companies, show top 10 and add summary line: "Also: X more companies"
  - Keep each company entry concise (1-2 lines maximum per company)
  - Use bullet points (•) for each company entry

List Queries:
• For specific item type queries (e.g., "what are our most popular products", "list all companies"):
  - Show up to 8 items before "+N more" unless user requests more
  - Include relevant details like usage examples, company names, or other context when available
  - Group by popularity, category, alphabetically, or by stage/priority as appropriate
• For general list queries, show up to 6 items before "+N more" unless user requests more
• User override handling:
  - "show all" or "list all" → Show all available items without truncation
  - "top X" or "show top X" → Show exactly X items (e.g., "top 5" shows 5 items)
  - "first X" or "last X" → Show exactly X items from beginning or end
  - Always respect explicit user requests for specific quantities

# COMPANY OUTPUT RULES
# -----------------------
COMPANY_OUTPUT_RULES = """
Company Profile Output Requirements:
• Use the Company Output Template structure ONLY for comprehensive company profile queries
• Start with *Company Name* (not ### Company Name) - ALWAYS replace with actual company name
• Adapt template sections based on query type:
  - Full profile queries: Use all sections (*Details*, *Timeline/Status*, *Comments*, *Contacts*, *Next steps*)
  - Contact queries: Focus on *Contacts* section, include *Details* if relevant
  - Status queries: Focus on *Timeline/Status* and *Next steps* sections
  - Product queries: Focus on *Details* section, include *Comments* if relevant
• Follow all General Output Requirements above
• Length: up to 300 words per company
• Only show "(na)" for fields the user asked for or standard template fields
• In Details section, ALL field labels must be bold: *Sales stage*:, *Product(s)*:, *Next step*:, *Estimated value*:
• For empty sections, still use proper header format: "*Section Name:*" followed by "(na)" on next line

Multi-Company Responses:
• One section per company
• Sort by most recent activity date, then by stage priority: Won, POC, Proposal, Qualified, Interest, Lost
• If more than 5 companies, show the top 5 and list the rest in one compact line with counts
• Example: "Also: 3 more companies (2 Qualified, 1 Interest)"

Note: The Company Output Template is specifically for company profile queries. Other query types should use appropriate formats as defined in the General Output Rules.
"""

FOCUSED_RESPONSE_RULES = """
Focused Response Requirements (for specific field queries):
• Use focused response format for single field requests (email, phone, contact name, etc.)
• Start with *[Company Name]* followed by the specific information requested
• Format: *[Company Name]*: [specific field value] or (na) if not available
• For contact queries: Show "Name, Role, email@domain.com" format
• For multiple contacts: List up to 3, then "+N more" if applicable
• Keep response concise - typically 1-3 lines maximum
• Do NOT use the full Company Output Template for single field requests

Examples:
• Query: "contact email at amd" → Response: "*AMD*: john.doe@amd.com"
• Query: "phone number for cisco" → Response: "*Cisco*: (555) 123-4567"
• Query: "amd contact info" → Response: "*AMD*: John Doe, Technical Lead, john.doe@amd.com"

COMPANY_OUTPUT_TEMPLATE = """
*Company Output Template Structure:*

IMPORTANT: Use this template ONLY for comprehensive company profile queries, NOT for specific field requests.

For company profile queries, use this structure (REPLACE [Company Name] with actual company name):

*[Company Name]*

*Details:*
• *Sales stage*: [value or (na)] (value where feature=sales_stage)
• *Product(s)*: [value or (na)] (value where feature=memverge_product)
• *Estimated value*: [value or (na)] (value where feature=estimated_deal_value)
• *Author/Owner*: [value or (na)] (value where feature=author)

*Timeline/Status:* (value where feature=status)
• Only 4 bullets (max) with dates in EDTF format when available, otherwise show as-is.
• Follow Date Handling Rules above for consistent formatting.
• Follow +N More Rules above for formatting
• Always format header as "*Timeline/Status:*" (with colon)

*Comments:* (value where feature=comments)
• Only 3 bullets (max) with dates in EDTF format when available, otherwise show as-is.
• Follow Date Handling Rules above for consistent formatting.
• Follow +N More Rules above for formatting
• Always format header as "*Comments:*" (with colon)
• If no comments, show "(na)" on the next line, not inline.

*Contacts:* (value where feature=primary_contact, job_title, email, phone)
• Use "_" for missing data: "Name, Role, email@domain.com" or "Name, _, email@domain.com" or "Name, Role, _"
• Follow +N More Rules above for formatting
• Always format header as "*Contacts:*" (with colon)
• If no contacts, show "(na)" on the next line, not inline.

*Next steps:* (value where feature=next_step)
• When including dates, place them BEFORE the text: "[--07-29] string"
• Follow +N More Rules above for formatting
• If no open items, show "(na)" on the next line, not inline.
• Always format as "*Next steps:*" (with colon)

NOTE: Do NOT use this template for single field requests like "email for amd" - use focused response format instead.
