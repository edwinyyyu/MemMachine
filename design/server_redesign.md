# MemMachine server redesign

Status: proposal, under review in its own PR against `speedkick`. It
replaces the tenant lifecycle draft in this file's history: the lifecycle
cannot be fixed inside the current API, configuration and wiring, so the
document covers the server. Companion:
`design/segment_store_shared_tables.md` (the segment store as shipped in
#1548). Tracking: #1574. Line references are to `speedkick` at 7752e4cb,
paths under `packages/server/src/memmachine_server` unless given in full.
Settings are named, never given numeric defaults: none has been measured.

## Scope

In: the data model (tenants and events), the HTTP API, configuration,
startup and wiring, tenant lifecycle, the event store, the episodic
memory subsystem with its two derived stores, properties and filtering,
and schema management (initial setup and migrations). Breaking changes
to the API and to the store ABCs are accepted.

Out, and not wired into the new server: short-term memory (callers manage
their own near-term context), semantic memory (cost high, benefit
unproven), declarative memory and the graph stores behind it (Neo4j,
NebulaGraph), the retrieval agent. The MCP surface gets one note.

Requirements that shape everything below:

- Horizontal scaling without sharding, at cluster scope: any process on
  any host serves any tenant, no process owns a tenant, nothing is
  coordinated in process memory. Twenty thousand tenants now; millions
  at the next levels of scale.
- Every component declares its concurrency scope, the widest deployment
  boundary within which concurrent instances may manage the same
  resources (`process`, `host`, `cluster`). A deployment declares the
  scope it runs at, and startup refuses any component narrower than
  that. The SQLite stores declare `process` or `host`; within their
  scope they obey every contract, and nothing about scale is asked of
  them.
- DDL that is not tenant-specific runs only in a dedicated setup step
  that serves no requests and cannot race. Tenant-specific DDL is the
  only DDL allowed anywhere else, and it is avoided where it would be
  expensive at cluster scope. No store in this design creates a table
  per tenant.
- Garbage that is never collected is unacceptable. Wasted writes are
  acceptable.
- Rejection of operations on a deleted tenant is structural: a store
  reads its registry row in the same statement as the data operation
  where both are in one SQL database, and after the operation
  everywhere else. No rejection compares clocks, and no lock is held
  across remote I/O. A clock is compared in one place, on the database
  side, to release a tombstone after a clean sweep, with a margin
  orders of magnitude above any write's timeout; every remote client
  is constructed with a request timeout, and the composition refuses
  one without.
- One client per provider per process, shared by every tenant.
- The tenant layer neither routes data operations nor knows the stores
  or the options a component takes.
- Resources are plain classes, wireable by hand, unaware of any
  configuration or injection system. Composition is Python; settings
  are data.
- No component of the current server is carried over unless named under
  "What is reused".

## What is wrong with the current server

Named so the redesign can be checked against it.

- Identity. The scope of every request is `(org_id, project_id)`, joined
  into `session_key = "org/project"` (`server/api_v2/service.py:38`),
  split back by string (`server/api_v2/router.py:251`), and defaulting
  to `universal/universal` when omitted
  (`packages/common/src/memmachine_common/api/spec.py:58`). "Session"
  names a memory scope, not a conversation; the documentation says
  "project"; store keys are a hash of the string
  (`episodic_memory/long_term_memory/service_locator.py:166`).
- Layers. A request passes `MemMachine` (`main/memmachine.py`, 1726
  lines), `EpisodicMemoryManager`, `EpisodicMemory` and `LongTermMemory`
  (a `match` over two backends) before reaching `EventMemory`, with a
  model translation at each layer: `MemoryMessage` to `EpisodeEntry` to
  `Episode` to `Event`.
- Lifecycle. A search or add on an unknown scope creates it
  (`main/memmachine.py:767`, `:826`; #1576). Deletion returns 204 and an
  in-process queue with no persistence or retry does the work
  (`main/memmachine.py:343`; #1575, #1577).
- Vector stores. Each keeps its collection registry inside its own
  backend (a registry collection on Qdrant and Milvus, a table in the
  store's SQLite file), and a collection handle keeps writing after
  `delete_collection`. Both follow from #1201's model: one process owned
  a collection, so a stale handle could only be that process's own, and
  a store depending on one backend only was worth more than a fence
  nobody needed. Under any-process-serves-any-tenant the handle is
  stale across processes and nothing rejects it (#1537, #1563).
- Configuration. Resources are built lazily behind double-checked locks
  (`common/resource_manager/`), `DatabaseManager` repeats the pattern
  seven times, locator functions assemble params (`*/service_locator.py`),
  `ResourceManagerImpl.build()` is never called by the server, a
  misconfigured provider silently disables a subsystem
  (`common/configuration/__init__.py:384`), every YAML key is lowercased
  (`:586`), an opt-in HTTP API mutates the running process
  (`server/api_v2/config_router.py`), and the configuration models are a
  second description of the components, hand-mapped onto their
  constructors.
- Errors. Status mapping is hand-written per handler, two handlers have
  none, an unknown exception serializes its traceback into the response
  (`server/api_v2/exceptions.py:49`), and an unhandled exception drops the
  connection instead of answering.
- Storage. Eight `create_all` sites in serving processes and one Alembic
  chain (#1570). Every ingested message is stored twice, in the
  `episodestore` table and as segments, linked by an `_episode_uid`
  property with no transaction between the two
  (`episodic_memory/long_term_memory/long_term_memory.py:386`).
  Re-ingesting an id duplicates segment rows.
- Filtering. A string query language with its own grammar
  (`common/filter/filter_parser.py`), user keys mangled behind an `m.`
  prefix, system fields homogeneous with user metadata, and a
  per-collection indexed-properties schema (#1573, #1535).

## Vocabulary

- Tenant: an isolated memory with its own configuration and lifecycle. It
  is not a user, a conversation or an agent run; an application maps
  those onto tenants by naming them. "Tenant" is chosen over "memory",
  "space" and "namespace" because it says isolation and lifecycle and
  nothing about what the application puts inside.
- Tenant name: the application's label. Any string up to 1024 bytes,
  unique among tenants that are not deleting or deleted, renamable.
- Tenant id: a UUID minted at creation, permanent, never reused. The
  tenant row outlives the tenant as a tombstone for as long as anything
  could remain under the id, which is what makes "never reused"
  enforced rather than hoped while it matters.
- Event: what a caller ingests: an id, a timestamp, an optional source
  id, an optional context, one or more content blocks, properties.
  Events are the caller's data; the event store records them and memory
  subsystems process them.
- Source id: the stable identifier of the entity responsible for an
  event's content, human, agent, tool or import, a bounded string the
  application owns. A system field beside `timestamp`, indexed and
  filtered by `source_ids`, so filtering is uniform over every event and
  "no source" is one state. Never rendered unless asked for.
- Context: the typed parts attached to an event's content for the
  steps that process it and for rendering, never for filtering. A
  context is a mapping from part kind to one part, each part a Pydantic
  model registered under its kind, so parts compose by merging and any
  step reads the one it needs by kind (`context.get(Author)`) without
  an order to agree on. No context is the empty mapping; a source with
  no good name to render has a `source_id` and no `author` part, and a
  name is a part's field rather than a property of the source, so
  several sources may share a name and one source may carry different
  names over time. The first kinds: `author` (`name`, the readable name
  as it was at the event) and `time_ranges` (the temporal signal of
  #1436, read by scoring, never rendered). A library user registers a
  kind the way a store kind is registered, and its part is stored,
  round-tripped and handed to that user's segmenter, deriver or scorer
  unchanged. Codec-encoded, stored with the event and copied to its
  segments. This replaces #1436's `CompositeContext`, an ordered list
  of a closed union: keyed parts need no ordering convention, no
  nesting, no depth-first search, and no edit to a core union to add
  one. `producer`, `produced_for` and the roles of the old episode
  model are not carried over, and nothing replaces them.
- Names at render time: the recorded name is what was true when the
  event happened, and what was embedded. Every hit and every expansion
  returns the segment's `source_id` and its context as data, so an
  application that knows a source's current name, or wants the id shown
  beside it so a reader can tell two names are one entity, renders that
  itself. The server's text rendering (`string_from_segment_context`)
  is a convenience that prints what was recorded, formatted by
  `FormatOptions`, which stays what it is: dates, times, locale,
  timezone. The application holds the directory; the server keeps none.
- Event store: the component that records a tenant's events, in the
  order they were ingested. The system of record.
- Memory subsystem: a component that processes a tenant's events into
  derived data and serves queries over it. This design has one,
  episodic memory (the current `EventMemory`, renamed: "event" is the
  ingestion type, not the memory). Segment and derivative keep their
  meanings from `event_memory/data_types.py`.
- Component with per-tenant resources: the event store and each memory
  subsystem. Both register with the tenant service the same way.
- Key: a UUID a store takes as the identity of a partition or
  collection. It is the tenant id, in every store.
- Key registry: the one shared implementation of per-key bookkeeping for
  stores whose data is not in a SQL database, injected into each such
  store as a view scoped to that store.
- Resource: any object the composition builds: a database engine, a
  provider client, a store, a component, the tenant service. A plain
  class or factory with a typed signature.
- Provider: a resource that is a process-wide model or backend client
  shared by every tenant: an embedder, a language model, a reranker, a
  database engine, a vector backend client.
- Template: a named block of per-component tenant options in the
  settings, copied into a tenant's configuration at creation. Nothing
  is built from a template.
- Tenant configuration: the resolved options recorded on the tenant
  row, one section per component, applied to the component by a job.
- Naming of values: settings (deployment), tenant configuration (per
  tenant, options), templates, overrides, defaults, request parameters,
  job arguments, partition configuration (per key). One word per kind,
  defined in `design/components/README.md`; in identifiers `Settings`
  and `Config`, Python's conventions, and never `conf`, `params`,
  `args` or `payload`.
- Job: a row describing one action for one component on one tenant.
  Four kinds, all defined and scheduled by the tenant service:
  `provision`, `delete` (the unlink, one call) and `sweep` (purging,
  batch by batch) for the tenant's lifecycle, `replay` for a subsystem's
  processing of the tenant's log. A component cannot define a kind.
- Reconciler: the role that claims and executes jobs and runs the
  tombstone pass. A process runs it when configured to; a deployment
  runs as many as it needs.
- Concurrency scope: `process` < `host` < `cluster`, the widest
  deployment boundary within which concurrent instances of a component
  may safely manage the same resources. Computed from a resource's
  constructor arguments at construction; a composition's scope is the
  minimum of its parts'. Declared and validated at startup, never
  enforced at runtime. "Host" is one operating system instance, which
  is what a file lock reaches; "node" is avoided as overloaded.

## Principles

1. Control plane and data plane are separate objects with separate
   endpoints. The tenant service creates, renames, configures and
   deletes tenants and records jobs, and is the only reader of the
   tenant table. Components serve data operations and own their
   per-tenant state, learning of tenants through their hooks.
2. A data operation names its tenant by id in the request, and every
   store operation names its key. There are no handles at the API and
   none in the stores: nothing is opened or closed per tenant, and a
   process holds no per-tenant state. A store may keep a private
   per-key cache for a backend that needs one, bounded by the store and
   invisible above it.
3. The tenant service knows a component only through its registration: a
   name, a tenant configuration model to validate against, and the
   hooks behind the four job kinds (`provision`, `delete`, `purge`,
   `replay`). It never sees a store or an option.
4. Stores take a UUID key and nothing else, and fence on that key. Each
   store is two ABCs behind one implementation: `<Store>Manager` for
   lifecycle and `<Store>` for data, the latter reached only through
   `manager.store`, so a data caller cannot reach a lifecycle operation
   and a lifecycle caller cannot reach data.
5. Every store rejects operations on a deleted key by itself, from a
   registry row keyed by the caller's UUID: in the same statement where
   the data is in the same SQL database, and by a check after the
   operation everywhere else. A crashed operation can leave a record
   under a dead key; purging and the tenant service's tombstone
   sweep collect it. No clock is compared, and no lock spans remote I/O.
6. Lifecycle steps are idempotent. There is no transaction across
   stores, so a step interrupted midway is completed by repeating it,
   and whatever a failed creation left behind is removed by the same
   path as a deletion.
7. Every lifecycle change is accepted, recorded as jobs, and reported
   on; none is refused for a failure the reconciler will retry. A caller
   polls or waits; it is never told "try again later".
8. Composition is Python: one function constructs every resource by
   calling constructors with the objects they depend on, in evaluation
   order, checked by the type checker. Settings are data: the scalar
   values a deployment sets, validated at startup, never mutated at
   runtime; a bad setting fails startup. A library user calls the same
   constructors.
9. Schema that is not tenant-specific is versioned migrations applied
   by an operator's command that serves nothing and races with nothing;
   serving and reconciler processes verify it and never run it.
   Tenant-specific DDL is the only DDL a job may run, and no store in
   this design runs any.

## Architecture

Every process runs the same binary and builds the same objects from the
settings, in this order:

1. Settings, read from the environment and an optional file, validated.
2. The composition, constructing every resource in evaluation order:
   database engines and backend clients, then embedders, language
   models and rerankers, then the key registry and stores, then the
   event store and each memory subsystem (each registering with the
   tenant service), then the ingest service, then the tenant service.
3. Schema verification: every component's version table is at head, or
   startup fails (see "Schema management").
4. The scope check: the minimum over every resource's concurrency scope
   must reach `server.concurrency_scope`, or startup fails naming the
   narrowest resource.
5. Roles, from `server.roles`: `api` binds the HTTP routers; `reconciler`
   starts the job loop and the tombstone pass. A single-host
   deployment runs both in one process; a cluster runs many `api`
   processes and as many `reconciler` processes as its job volume
   needs, one at least.

Who knows what:

- Tenant service: the tenant table, the job table, the registrations.
- Event store: its tables, keyed by tenant id.
- Memory subsystem: its derived stores, its own per-tenant table
  (watermark, applied configuration and its version), the providers it
  was given, and the event store as a reader.
- Ingest service: the event store and the list of subsystems.
- Stores: their backend, their keys, and their own registry rows.
- Routers: the tenant service, the ingest service, the event store, the
  subsystems.

Dependency direction: the registration interface is defined by the
tenant package; component packages import it and nothing else from the
tenant package. The tenant package imports no component. No resource
imports the composition. Every contract is an abstract base class, for
the reasons in `design/components/README.md`; a `Protocol` describes
only an object this code does not define, of which there is none.

Horizontal scaling, at `cluster` scope: all shared state is in the
databases and the vector backend; per-process state is caches any
process can rebuild; concurrent creates are arbitrated by a unique
index, concurrent jobs by row locks, concurrent data operations and
deletes by store fences. A `host` deployment is several processes on
one host sharing SQLite files; a `process` deployment is one process.
The contracts are the same at every scope; the scope says only which
resources may share state with how many others.

## Tenant registry

Two tables in the tenant database. Every transition is one transaction
on them. Only the tenant service reads or writes them.

`tenants`:

- `id UUID PK`.
- `name TEXT NULL`, unique index. NULL from the moment deletion starts,
  so a new tenant can take the name at once and gets a new id.
- `former_name TEXT NULL`: the name at deletion time, for operators.
- `state`: `provisioning`, `active`, `deleting`, `deleted`.
- `config JSON`: one object per component name. The record of
  what was requested; each component holds its own applied copy.
- `config_version INTEGER`: incremented by every configuration
  update.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `swept_at`.

`tenant_jobs`:

- `id PK`, `tenant_id`, `component`, `action`, `arguments JSON`; unique
  on `(tenant_id, component, action)`.
- `state`: `pending`, `done`.
- `arguments`: for `provision`, the configuration version the job applies.
- `attempts`, `last_outcome` (`more` or `error`), `last_error`,
  `last_run_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. The row records what
  happened; when a job is next eligible is computed at claim time from
  those columns and the reconciler's settings, so a change of schedule
  applies to every pending job at once and rewrites no row, and an
  operator's retry is `attempts = 0`.

A `deleted` row is a tombstone: id, former name, `deleted_at`,
`swept_at`, nothing else. It does two jobs. It enforces "never reused":
minting is an insert on the primary key, so a duplicate id, whether
from a collision, a replayed id, or a registry restored from a backup
the stores were not restored to, fails at the tenant service before any
store is touched. And it drives the tombstone pass under "Tenant
lifecycle", which is what collects a record a crashed operation left
under the key after purging had finished. A tombstone is not kept
forever: the sweep removes it on the first pass in which every
component's `purge` found nothing under the id and `deleted_at` is
older than `tombstones.retention` on the database clock, a retention of
the order of a day. What that assumes is that no write is in flight
longer than the retention: every remote client has a request timeout,
so a stale write, which is always issued before the delete commits
(the row read before a write is a check), lands within that timeout
plus whatever the backend and the network can queue, minutes at the
outside, and the retention exceeds it by orders of magnitude. After the
prune, a reused id (a `uuid4` collision, or a registry restored from a
backup) creates cleanly and inherits nothing, since the stores hold
nothing under it. The case this leaves open, a write delayed longer
than the retention, is accepted as less likely than the failures the
design does not defend against either.

Rename is an update of `name`. No store key contains the name, which is
why names can be arbitrary strings while store keys are the 32 hex
characters every backend accepts.

## Tenant lifecycle

Create, `POST /v1/tenants`:

1. Resolve the configuration: the named template (default `default`),
   overlaid with the request's per-component overrides, each section
   validated by its component's tenant configuration model. An unknown
   component name or an invalid option is 422.
2. Insert the tenant row as `provisioning` and one `provision` job per
   registered component, in one transaction. A duplicate name fails on
   the unique index: 409 `tenant_exists`, and nothing else. A caller
   that wants the existing tenant looks it up by name; an error response
   does not carry another tenant's record, and there is no get-or-create
   flag.
3. Respond 202 with the tenant in `provisioning`. With `?wait=` the
   request instead blocks until the tenant is `active` or the wait
   elapses, and responds 201 or 202 accordingly. While waiting, the
   `api` process executes this tenant's jobs itself, through the same
   claim as a reconciler, so a single-process deployment completes the
   create inside the request; a failed step is left for a reconciler,
   never surfaced as an error to the creator.
4. `GET /v1/tenants/{id}` shows the state and each job's attempts and
   last error. The tenant becomes `active` when the last `provision` job's
   transaction marks it done.

Delete, `DELETE /v1/tenants/{id}`:

1. One transaction: `state = deleting`, `former_name = name`,
   `name = NULL`, `deleted_at = now()`, and one `delete` job per
   registered component. Allowed from `provisioning` and `active`; a
   repeat while `deleting` responds the same 202.
2. Respond 202 with the tenant in `deleting`; `?wait=` as for create. A
   reconciler in the same process is woken; every other reconciler sees
   the jobs at its next poll.
3. A reconciler executes the `delete` jobs: one call to each
   component's `delete`, which makes the tenant unreachable in every one
   of its stores. Seconds, not minutes; nothing is purged yet.
4. When every `delete` job is done, one transaction sets the tenant row
   `deleted`, inserts one `sweep` job per component, and removes the
   other job rows. `GET` then returns 404; the row stays as the
   tombstone, and the sweeps purge in the background.
5. A `sweep` job's step calls `purge`, one bounded batch, repeatedly
   until it reports nothing remains or the step's time budget
   (`reconciler.step_duration`) is spent; it is done when nothing
   remains. `purge` is idempotent, so a repeated batch is harmless.

Tombstone pass: a duty of the tenant service, run by reconciler
processes on `reconciler.sweep_interval`, in every one of them without
exclusion. It claims `deleted` rows with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`,
oldest `swept_at` first, bounded per call, resets each one's `sweep`
jobs to pending, and stamps `swept_at`; the sweeps then run as jobs.
This is what collects the one write that can land after purging (see
"How a store fences"); components whose stores cannot hold such a write
return `DONE` on the first batch. When a tombstone's sweeps have all
completed with `purge` finding nothing on their first batch, and
`deleted_at` is older than `tombstones.retention` on the database
clock, the pass removes the row and its sweep rows. It is the only
scheduled duty in the system.

Configuration update, `PATCH /v1/tenants/{id}` with `config`:

- The tenant stays `active` throughout. Each component validates its
  section's change against its model, in which every option is mutable
  or immutable. An option is immutable exactly when changing it would
  require touching existing data (the embedder; anything that reshapes
  stored rows); mutable options apply to events processed after the
  change or to reads (a reranker, search defaults, segmenter options).
  An immutable option in the patch is 422, and there is no "expensive
  but allowed" class.
- One transaction writes the configuration, increments
  `config_version`, and inserts (or resets) an `provision` job per
  changed component carrying the new version. Respond 202; `?wait=`
  blocks until every such job is done.
- How it reaches the server processes: the `provision` job calls the
  component's hook with the new section, and the hook writes it, with
  its version, into the component's own per-tenant row. Every request
  reads that row, so the next request on any process uses the new
  options. No process is notified; the row is the channel. `GET` shows
  the requested version and, per component, the applied version.

Rename, `PATCH /v1/tenants/{id}` with `name`: one update; 409 on a
duplicate.

States: `provisioning -> active -> deleting -> deleted`, and
`provisioning -> deleting`. There is no failed state. A job that raises
is rescheduled with exponential backoff (`reconciler.backoff`) and keeps
`attempts` and `last_error` on its row for as long as it takes. An
operator fixes the cause and the next attempt succeeds. A tenant in
`provisioning` or `deleting` past `reconciler.stuck_after` is logged
with its jobs' last errors, and logged again each time the age doubles.

Reconciler role:

- One loop per process that has the role. It polls every
  `reconciler.poll_interval` and when woken locally.
- Claim: the `pending` rows that are eligible now, oldest first by
  `COALESCE(last_run_at, created_at)`, `LIMIT n FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
  Eligible means `last_run_at IS NULL`, or `last_run_at + delay <=
  now()` with `delay` computed in the statement from the settings:
  `reconciler.purge_interval` after a `more` outcome,
  `reconciler.backoff` raised to `attempts` after an error. The row lock
  is held for the duration of the step: the hook runs, and the same
  transaction records the outcome and commits. A crashed process's lock
  is released by the database and the job is claimable at once. There
  is no lease; the one `now()` is the database's and decides only when
  a job is eligible, never whether an effect is valid. On SQLite the
  same statement without `SKIP LOCKED` under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`;
  concurrent reconcilers serialize there.
- Execute: the component's hook for the job's action, with the job's arguments
  (for `provision`, the tenant's configuration section at the job's
  version; for `delete`, the one unlink call; for `sweep`, `purge`
  until `DONE` or the time budget; for `replay`, the log). `DONE` marks
  the job done; a spent budget or `MORE` records `last_outcome = more`
  and `last_run_at`; an exception records `error`, the message, and
  `attempts + 1`. The transaction that marks a `provision` or `delete` job done
  checks the tenant's remaining jobs of that action and applies the
  state transition if none remain. Hooks are idempotent, so a step
  repeated after a crash is harmless.
- Reset: the ingest service sets a tenant's `replay` jobs to pending
  through the tenant service's `reset_replay(tenant_id)`, in the
  ingest's own transaction where the engines are shared and after its
  commit otherwise; a running `replay` step keeps running and the row is
  claimable again when it ends.
- Serialization per tenant. Every lifecycle transition and every job
  step holds the tenant row's lock for its transaction: a request's
  transaction takes `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the tenant row before it
  changes state or inserts jobs, and a reconciler's claim, after locking
  the job row, locks the tenant row too and holds both for the step.
  Transitions and steps for one tenant are therefore totally ordered.
  A step re-reads the tenant's state under the lock before calling a
  hook: a `provision` or `replay` step on a tenant that is `deleting`
  marks itself done without calling anything. A delete request that
  finds a `provision` step running waits for it to finish, then, in its
  own transaction, marks every remaining pending `provision` job done
  and inserts the `delete` jobs. So no `provision` hook runs after a
  `delete` hook for the same tenant, and no component ever sees
  `purge` on a live key, which is why `purge` on a live key is an
  error rather than a case. On SQLite the file's write lock serializes
  the same way. The cost is one row lock per step, held for a bounded
  step, on a row nothing else locks; plain reads of the tenant row, as
  `GET` does, are not blocked by it. Every concurrent pair on one
  tenant and its outcome is tabulated in
  `design/components/tenant_service.md`; the data-path pairs (two
  ingests, a failed replay step, a delete racing a replay, a search
  racing an ingest) in `design/components/episodic_memory_manager.md`,
  where the watermark is defined to move only forward and a `replay`
  step to resume from it.
- Cost: a reconciler holds one database connection per job it is
  executing, for the step's duration; steps are bounded per call by
  their hooks, and `reconciler.jobs_per_pass` bounds the connections.

## Component contract

A component with per-tenant resources registers with the tenant service
at startup:

- `name`: its section in tenant configuration and, for a memory
  subsystem, its path segment in the API (`episodic_memory`,
  `/episodic-memory`).
- `tenant_config`: a Pydantic model for its section, every field
  mutable or immutable, with defaults. Provider references in it are
  ids that the component validates against the providers it was
  constructed with. The tenant service calls `validate(section)` and
  `validate_update(old, new)` and never reads a field.
- Hooks, each idempotent, bounded per call, allowed to raise (the
  reconciler retries):
  - `provision(tenant_id, section) -> None`: create the component's
    resources for the tenant if absent, verify the immutable options if
    present, apply the mutable ones, record the section and its version
    in the component's per-tenant row.
  - `delete(tenant_id) -> None`: make the tenant unreachable in every
    one of the component's stores (each store's logical delete, a row
    flip) and remove the component's per-tenant row. Fast; no
    purging.
  - `purge(tenant_id) -> DONE | MORE`: remove a bounded amount of what
    the component's stores hold under the tenant id; `DONE` when
    nothing is found. Called by a `sweep` job, for as long as
    the tombstone exists.
  - `replay(tenant_id) -> DONE | MORE`: process a bounded amount of the
    tenant's log beyond the component's watermark; the component's
    only processing path (see "Episodic memory").

A memory subsystem additionally exposes to the ingest service and the
routers: `encode(tenant_id, events)`, `forget(tenant_id, event_ids)`,
and its queries.

Data operations:

- Every request reads the component's own per-tenant row (absent: the
  tenant is unknown to this component), takes the object built for that
  tenant's structural configuration from a cache keyed by configuration
  (see "Episodic memory"), and calls it with the tenant id and the
  request's per-call options. One indexed read; no per-tenant object
  exists.
- Every store operation is fenced by the store's own registry row, which
  also supplies what the operation needs to address the tenant (the
  codec configuration, the container, the collection UUID). A key that
  is not live raises one error type.
- On an unknown tenant or a not-live-key error, the router asks the
  tenant service for the tenant's state and answers 404 (no row, or
  `deleted`) or 409 (`provisioning` or `deleting`). No component reads
  the tenant table.

## Event store

The system of record. Shared tables in a SQL database, keyed by the
tenant id, with the fence under "Store contracts".

- Registry row per key.
- `events`: key, event id, timestamp, source id, context and blocks
  (codec-encoded), properties. Unique on `(key, event id)`, which is what makes
  ingest idempotent per event id.
- A log per key of additions and deletions, each entry a position, a
  kind and the event id. Positions are assigned under the key's
  registry row locked `FOR UPDATE`, so ingests to one tenant serialize
  inside that one short transaction and positions are contiguous and
  commit-ordered within the key. The log is what subsystems replay,
  from one watermark each, so every addition and deletion a client was
  acknowledged for reaches every subsystem at least once without the
  client retrying; processing is only ever a replay of the log by a
  `replay` job, executed inline in the request where a deployment wants
  the latency and by a reconciler otherwise. The log is the
  per-tenant data queue and the job table is the control queue; neither
  is a message broker, because each pairs with a row in one transaction
  that a broker could not join. Schema in
  `design/components/event_store.md`.
- `create_partition(key)` (strict; see "Create is strict"),
  `delete_partition(key)` (logical, O(1), idempotent),
  `purge_partition(key) -> DONE | MORE`, `purge_deleted_partitions()`
  for library users without a tenant service.
- Data operations, each taking the key: `add_events(key, events) ->
  (stored, skipped)`, `delete_events(key, ids)`, `get_events(key,
  ids)`, `list_events(key, filter, since, before, cursor, limit)`,
  `read_log(key, after, limit)`, `head(key)`.

Ingest, `POST /v1/tenants/{id}/events`, in the ingest service:

1. `add_events` on the event store, one transaction: the events and
   their `added` log entries; ids already present are skipped and
   reported.
2. In the same transaction, reset every subsystem's `replay` job for the
   tenant to pending, so the log is processed by whichever reconciler
   claims it next. Where the process has the reconciler role, or
   `ingest.inline` is set, execute those jobs now through the same
   claim, so a single-process deployment processes inside the request.
3. Respond 202 with stored ids, skipped ids and the batch's last
   position; `?wait=` blocks until every subsystem's watermark has
   reached it and then responds 200. The client is acknowledged when the
   events are durable; processing is observable, never assumed.

Delete events, `POST /v1/tenants/{id}/events/delete`: `delete_events`
on the event store, which removes the rows and appends `deleted` log
entries, and resets the `replay` jobs the same way; 202, `?wait=` as
above. Subsystems apply the deletion by replaying the log; nothing
depends on the caller retrying.

## Episodic memory

The one memory subsystem: the current `EventMemory` renamed, processing
events into segments and derivative embeddings and answering searches.

Derived stores:

- Segment store: segments and their derivative links, as shipped in
  #1548.
- Vector store: derivative embeddings, an index.

Both are keyed by the tenant id. There is no rebuild of derived data: a
full reprocessing costs what an ingestion costs, so it is one, into a
new tenant. What the event store gives the subsystem is repair of
partial processing (`replay`) and processing of history for a
subsystem enabled on an existing tenant, whose watermark starts at zero.

Per-tenant row (the subsystem's own table): tenant id, watermark (the
last event position processed), applied configuration and its version.

Identifiers: segment and derivative ids are minted (uuid4). Idempotency
is per event, not per derived row: `encode` for an event first forgets
that event's derived rows, so repeating it after a crash, or from a
`replay`, leaves one copy.

Operations, in the order the stores are touched:

- `encode` and `forget`: for each log entry in order, an `added` entry is
  segmented, derived, embedded and written (segments, then vectors) and
  a `deleted` entry is forgotten; then the watermark advances past the
  batch. A crash mid-batch leaves partial derived data behind the
  watermark, which the next replay reprocesses (forget first, so one
  copy).
- `replay` (job): the subsystem's only processing path. One job per
  (tenant, subsystem), reset to pending by every ingest and deletion,
  claimed by a reconciler that holds only the job's own row lock, so a
  tenant's subsystems process in parallel while each is a single
  consumer and therefore processes in commit order. It reads the log
  after the watermark, processes the batch as above, and returns `MORE`
  until the log has nothing newer. There is no separate repair: a
  failure records an error on the job and the next attempt resumes from
  the watermark. Positions exist for this: they make "what has this
  subsystem processed" one integer per tenant, "what is left" a range,
  and the lag a subtraction.
- Search: embed the query; split the filter and choose the plan under
  "Properties and filtering"; vector query (checked against the store's
  registry row after the query, inside the vector store); segment
  contexts; on request, the full events from the event store. Scores
  are cosine similarity throughout; there is no similarity metric
  option.
- Expand: the neighbourhood of a segment or event in the tenant's one
  total order, `before` and `after` counted in segments or events, the
  way claude-memory walks a conversation around a memory; one indexed
  read on the segment store, no embedding. Specified in
  `design/components/episodic_memory.md`.
- `forget`: look up segments and derivatives; delete vector records;
  delete segments.

Objects per configuration, options per request. `EpisodicMemory` (the
current `EventMemory`) keeps its shape: one embedder, one segmenter,
one deriver, constructed with them, its operations taking the key and,
for `query`, the reranker as an object. It is a configured object,
never built by the composition. The resource is
`EpisodicMemoryManager`, the name repurposed: constructed with the
event store, the segment store, the vector store, and the embedders and
rerankers the composition built, as mappings from id to object. It
registers with the tenant service, owns the per-tenant table and a
cache of `EpisodicMemory` objects keyed by structural configuration
(embedder id, segmenter and deriver options), and serves the routes.
The object for embedder `e` is built with `embedders[e]` and
`vector_store.for_container(e)`, the container-scoped view of rule 4,
so a dispatch error raises instead of writing another model's vectors
into a container; the embedder and its container are bound in one
constructor call. On a request the manager reads the tenant's applied
configuration from its per-tenant row, takes the object for it, fills
each per-request option the request left out with the tenant's default,
resolves a reranker id to the object, and makes one call.

That is all the manager does: dispatch, defaults, validation. It holds
no search or ingest logic, translates no models, and has one method per
operation with the same types as `EpisodicMemory`. Reranking stays
inside `EpisodicMemory.query`, because it is part of computing the
result (an over-fetch scored and cut to `limit`), and moving it up
would split the search across two classes to save a parameter. One
layer that changes only scope, a tenant id to an object and ids to
objects, is the least a per-tenant configuration can need, and it is
not the layering this document removes, which was four layers each
translating models and branching on backends.

In the settings a deployment declares which embedders and rerankers
exist; the standard composition builds them and hands all of them to
the manager. Products never appear in settings. A deployment that
wants a memory type to offer a subset names the ids in that manager's
settings.

What a request may vary is not bound into objects at all; it is a request
parameter, passed as an argument of the call. The reranker, `limit`,
`expand_context`, the minimum score and `include_events` are parameters of
`query`. The tenant's section supplies their defaults; a request may override
any of them, the reranker within the ids the deployment offers, validated by
the manager. Nothing that ingest does varies per request. The division is rule
5's: an option that decides where or how records are written is structural and
bound; what only shapes an answer is a request parameter.

A tenant naming an id the deployment did not build is rejected at
creation and at `PATCH` by the manager's own validation. Changing the
embedder is not a `PATCH`, because its container holds the data;
changing the segmenter or deriver options applies to later events;
changing the reranker or a search default takes effect on the next
request.

Tenant configuration section `episodic_memory`, with mutability:

- `embedder` (provider id): immutable; a different embedder is a new
  tenant and a new ingestion.
- `reranker` (provider id or null): mutable; the default for a search,
  overridable per request.
- `segmenter`, `deriver`: their options; mutable, applying to events
  processed after the change.
- `search`: default `limit`, `expand_context`, minimum score; mutable;
  each overridable per request.

Episodic memory uses no language model today (both segmenters and both
derivers are deterministic; the embedder is the only model call). The
section gains a `language_model` id when a deriver needs one.

Hooks:

- `provision`: create the partition and the collection under the tenant
  id; an existing `live` row is this component's own earlier attempt
  and is success, a `creating` row is resumed, a `dropping` row is a
  reused key and raises (see "Create is strict"); insert the per-tenant
  row if absent, else verify immutable options and apply mutable ones.
- `delete`: `delete_partition` on the segment store,
  `delete_collection` on the vector store, remove the per-tenant row.
- `purge`: `purge_partition` and `purge_collection`; `DONE` when
  both report done.

## Properties and filtering

Two tiers of fields, one mechanism underneath. The reference is the
`default` branch of edwinyyyu/MemMachine (commits 27b3279b, 822ccb6b,
2d5dc2b5), adjusted where noted.

System fields. Defined by the server, first-class in the API, typed: for
an event, `id`, `timestamp` and `source_id`. Search takes them as
named
parameters, `since` and `before` (inclusive and exclusive, so ranges
meet without overlap) and `source_ids` (a list; a source's rendered
name lives in the context and is never filtered). They are never
spelled
inside the user filter, so no caller and no model decides between
`timestamp` and some prefixed form of it. Underneath, each system field
is stored as a reserved property key, `memmachine_<system>_<field>`,
built by one function that validates the key against the stores' naming
contract at import time; the prefix is the distribution name, so its
uniqueness is the package registry's. Stores therefore index and filter
system fields with the same machinery as user properties, and a caller
key beginning with the prefix is rejected on the way in.

User properties. `properties` on an event: keys `[a-z0-9_]`, bounded by
the stores' naming contract, not reserved; values scalar only: string
(bounded by `properties.max_string_bytes`), integer, float, boolean,
datetime; no lists, no nesting, no nulls (absence is the only way a
field holds nothing); at most `properties.max_keys` keys per event.
Scalar-only is what every backend accepts (Chroma rejects nested values;
S3 Vectors caps filterable metadata at 2 KB per vector). Long text is
content, not a property: it goes in a block. Small machine data (an
external id, a source URL) is a property, which every hit returns and
which stays filterable through the segment store. There is no separate
opaque metadata field.

Readable metadata, a suggestion. Structured metadata that is meant to
be read rather than filtered could be a block of its own type,
`{"type": "json", "data": {...}}`, bounded by `blocks.max_bytes`. For:
it rides the content path the event already has, codec-encoded and
stored with the event, reconstructed with it, and given a per-type
policy by the segmenter and deriver, so it is never filterable, gets no
derivatives by default (a tenant option embeds it as text), and is
returned by context expansion or not as its type decides. Whether it
occupies a segment is that policy's choice: a type whose processing
produces no segment stays with the event, is returned with it, and
never enters an expanded context. Against: it is less obvious to a
user than a named field, which the API schema and example would have to
carry; and it invites overuse of a flexible pattern, where every new
need becomes a block type rather than a designed field. Proposed, not
decided; see "Open questions".

Propagation. Properties are set at ingest and are immutable; changing an
event's properties is a delete and a re-ingest. The event store holds
them. Segments and derivatives carry a verbatim copy of their event's
properties; that is a clause of the segmenter and deriver contracts,
because filtering in the segment store depends on it. Vector records
carry only the declared subset, below.

Declared, not dynamic, indexes. The deployment declares, per vector
store, which user property keys are indexed inside its containers and
with which types (`indexed_properties`), one schema for every container
of that store, created by the schema command (#1573, #1535). Nothing
creates a filter index at runtime, per tenant, or from a request; the
current per-collection `indexed_properties_schema` goes. System fields
are always declared. A user property that is not declared is still
filterable, through the segment store, where a deployment adds an
expression index online (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` on PostgreSQL)
without touching the vector store or any co-tenant.

The vector store rejects every key it has not been declared, on both
paths: a record carrying an undeclared property key is an error on
`upsert`, and a filter naming one is an error on `query`. An undeclared
key therefore does not exist in the vector store, rather than being
stored write-only or scanned for; an unindexed filter is unrepresentable
at the store instead of a silent full scan; and the split between
declared and undeclared predicates is the subsystem's job before the
call, never something a store guesses at. This is the rule the
reference branch arrived at, for the same reasons: a vector store's
properties have one purpose, being filtered on, since queries return
ids and scores and never properties, so an unfilterable property there
is data nothing gives back.

Filter representation. A filter is a tree, constructed, never parsed:
the closed union from the reference, `Equals`, `NotEquals`, `Ordering`
over numbers and datetimes only (ordering strings depends on how a
store encodes them; ordering booleans is meaningless), `In` over a
homogeneous list, `IsMissing`, n-ary `And` and `Or`, `Not`, compiled by
each store with an exhaustive `match`, so a node a store does not handle
is a type error rather than a query-time one. At the API and in MCP a
filter is a JSON object validated by the schema generated from that
union, for example
`{"and": [{"eq": {"field": "kind", "value": "note"}},
{"gte": {"field": "score", "value": 3}}]}`. There is no string language,
nothing to learn beyond the schema, and nothing that parses successfully
into a different filter than intended; an MCP tool exposes the schema as
its parameter, which a model fills more reliably than a grammar. A field
in a filter must be a legal user key; system fields have their own
parameters. Semantics: a predicate matches only a record holding a value
of the compared type; `NotEquals` keeps records holding a differing
comparable value, and `Not(Equals)` also keeps records holding none.

Routing. Where a predicate is evaluated depends on what the backend can
do and on how selective the predicate is; the caller never chooses.

- Declared keys, system fields included, are evaluated inside the vector
  search on every backend that filters during the search (Qdrant,
  Milvus, Weaviate, S3 Vectors, sqlite-vec, pgvector), which is what
  keeps a filtered search returning enough results instead of filtering
  away the ones it found.
- A store also declares the filter nodes it can evaluate during the
  search (`supported_filter_nodes`). Every backend evaluates equality,
  ordering on numbers and datetimes, membership and conjunction; some
  cannot evaluate a negation, a disjunction or a missing-key test
  (Chroma's `where` has no `$not`, `$ne` or `$exists`; sqlite-vec's KNN
  takes comparisons joined by `AND` only). A predicate a store cannot
  evaluate is routed exactly like an undeclared key: to the segment
  store, where SQL evaluates the whole language. One language, two
  places of evaluation; nothing diverges between SQL and vector
  filters. The table is in `design/components/filters_and_properties.md`.
- Undeclared keys, and predicates the store cannot evaluate, never
  reach the vector store. Episodic memory splits the filter: the part
  the store evaluates goes to the vector query; the rest is
  resolved in the segment store by a bounded probe
  (`filter.selective_limit`). If the matching segments fit under it,
  their derivative ids become an allowlist the vector store scores
  directly (`get_cosine_similarity`, or the backend's id-restricted
  search). If not, the vector query runs with the declared part alone,
  over-fetches with bounded widening up to `filter.max_overfetch`, and
  the segment store drops the seeds that do not match. At the cap the
  search returns what survived, which can be fewer than `limit`.
- A backend that cannot filter during the search (the usearch engine)
  is handed an allowlist by its store, computed the same way over the
  store's own records table.

Limits are maximums. Every count a caller passes is a maximum: `limit`
on search is the most hits returned, and a filtered search may return
fewer. Nothing is called "top k", which promises exactly k.

## Store contracts

Every store takes a UUID key and nothing else. The string key contract
(charset, 32 bytes, validators, hashing in `partition_key_for_session`)
is retired, and so is the segment store's incarnation: with keys never
reused, the registry row keyed by the caller's UUID is the whole fence.

### How a store fences

A store keeps one registry row per key: a store whose data is in a SQL
database keeps it in a table beside the data; every other store keeps it
in the key registry (below). The row holds liveness, the store's phase
for the key, and whatever the store needs to address the key on its
backend, so the fence read is also the lookup and nothing is opened per
tenant.

Stores whose data is in a SQL database (the event store, the segment
store, pgvector, the SQLite stores): the data statement carries the
liveness predicate, `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM <registry> WHERE key = ? AND
live)`; a write's transaction takes the row `FOR SHARE` and the logical
delete takes it `FOR UPDATE`, as shipped in #1548. Those locks are in
the same database as the data, with no remote I/O inside the
transaction, so they cost nothing and give exactness: after the delete
commits, no row can be written under the key. On SQLite, `BEGIN
IMMEDIATE` takes the file's write lock and the check runs inside it;
the delete waits up to `busy_timeout` and raises past it.

Stores whose data is elsewhere (the vector stores on Qdrant, Milvus,
Pinecone, S3 Vectors, Weaviate, Chroma): read the row for the address;
perform the remote operation, a write acknowledged as applied (Qdrant
`wait=True`; Milvus with strong consistency); then read the row again
and raise the not-live error if the key is no longer live. Two indexed
reads per operation, no lock, no transaction spanning the remote call,
and a logical delete that is a row flip that waits for nothing. A
completed operation therefore never reports success on a dead key and
never returns a dead key's records.

What this does not guarantee, and what handles it. An operation that
crashes between its remote write and its check leaves a record under a
key that may be dead. The sweep's `purge` removes it, and if it
landed after that purge's last pass, the tombstone pass does. That is
the one residual, and it is inherent: the registry row and the backend
write are not one atomic action, so any ordering leaves a window in
which the check's outcome and the write's landing are separated by an
in-flight request of unbounded delay. Only the backend can close it, by
checking a fencing token per write, which no vector database offers per
tenant, or by making the tenant a native object whose drop fails later
writes (Weaviate tenants, Chroma collections, SQLite tables, Qdrant
shard keys, the last rejected for scale). Everywhere a metadata database
is paired with a non-transactional store the answer is the same as here:
a soft-delete marker, asynchronous purging, and periodic
reconciliation of orphans.

Why no lock across the remote write. A share lock held across the write
makes the delete wait for in-flight writers, so that for live writers no
write lands after the delete commits and purge's first pass is
complete. It costs a pooled connection held idle across every remote
write, a delete that waits, and settings that couple pool size to write
concurrency and the idle-in-transaction timeout to the longest remote
write. And it does not remove the residual, because a session that dies
with a request in flight releases the lock before the backend applies
the write, so the sweep is needed anyway. The check after the write
reaches the same end state with none of that cost. A compensating
delete, the writer removing what it wrote when its check fails, is not
done either: a crash before it defeats it, so it guarantees nothing the
sweep does not already, and it would be a second code path with its own
failures.

Why no lease, anywhere. A lease is a row saying "holder H owns this
until T". The holder cannot know it still holds it when it acts without
comparing a clock, and between that comparison and the act the lease can
expire and be taken over, so a late effect is prevented only if the
resource rejects a stale holder by a fencing token, which is the
backend cooperation just described as unavailable. The clock compared
must be the database's, never the process's, so every check is a round
trip anyway; acquire, renew and release are row writes; and there is no
queue, so after expiry whoever asks first wins. Where this design needs
exclusion, the reconciler's job claim and the SQL stores' pins, it uses
a database row lock: held in the lock manager's memory, released the
instant the holder's session ends, waiters queued, the database doing
the rejecting. The lease once considered for vector writes was not a
mutual-exclusion lease at all but a shared, time-limited validation with
a purge delayed past its expiry; the check after the write is that
validation with the clock removed.

Alternatives rejected for the remote stores: accepting bounded leakage
(garbage that is never collected is unacceptable); delaying purging
past the longest possible write (a clock comparison); per-tenant native
structures on every backend (#1564: they do not reach the tenant
counts required).

Scope declarations, computed from constructor arguments:

| Resource | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Tenant registry, event store, segment store, key registry | `cluster` on PostgreSQL; `host` on a SQLite file; `process` on in-memory SQLite |
| Vector store | the minimum of its backend's and its key registry's: networked Qdrant, Milvus, Pinecone, S3 Vectors, Weaviate, Chroma are `cluster`; local-mode Qdrant and Milvus are `process`; sqlite-vec is `host` (registry and data in one file, under the file lock); the usearch store is `process` (index state in process memory) |
| Reconciler, ingest service, routers | any; they hold no shared state of their own |

### The key registry

One implementation, `SqlKeyRegistry`: a table `key_registry(scope, key,
state, address, updated_at)` in a SQL database the deployment gives it,
`state` one of `creating`, `live`, `dropping`, `address` an opaque
document. It exists so that the per-key bookkeeping every non-SQL store
needs is written once, and so that those stores share a database
without sharing rows.

A store never receives the registry itself. Its constructor takes a
`KeyRegistry`, which exists only as a view scoped to one scope name:
`create(key, address)` (strict), `get(key)`, `set_state(key, state)`,
`remove(key)`, each constrained to the view's scope in the statement it
issues, so a store structurally cannot read or change another store's
rows. The composition produces the view, by
`registry.scoped("vector-store")`, and the registry refuses a second
claim on a scope at startup. A SQL-backed store does not use it:
its registry table sits beside its data, where the fence can be in the
statement.

### Create is strict

`create_partition(key)` and `create_collection(key, container)` insert
the registry row and raise `KeyExistsError` if any row exists under the
key, in any state. They are not idempotent, on purpose: a store cannot
tell a retry of its caller's own create from a create under a key
someone else chose, and only the caller can, so there is no
open-or-create at the store.

Idempotency lives in the component's `provision`, which knows the key's
provenance: the tenant service minted the id on the tenant table's
primary key before any job ran, so a `live` row under the key can only
be this component's own earlier attempt, and `provision` treats it as
success; a `creating` row is an interrupted attempt of its own, and
`provision` resumes it; a `dropping` row means the key had a previous
life, which the tenant service's tombstone makes impossible for the
server while anything remains under the key and which a library user
reusing keys can cause, and `provision` raises `KeyReusedError` for an
operator.

What every store operation does with a key whose row is present but
not `live` (`creating` and `dropping`; a SQL store's row while its purge
is pending), and with no row at all. Only `provision` proceeds on
`creating`, as above:

| Operation | present, not live | no row |
| --- | --- | --- |
| create | `KeyExistsError` | creates |
| write | not-live error; a remote write already sent is garbage until purged | not-live error |
| read | not-live error | not-live error |
| logical delete | returns; idempotent | returns; idempotent |
| purge | proceeds; the row goes when nothing remains | deletes by key in every container; `DONE` when nothing is found |

### Segment store

As shipped in #1548, with these changes:

- Key type `UUID`; the `incarnation` column of every table becomes the
  key, the purge queue is keyed by the key, and the store mints nothing.
  The incarnation existed to keep a new life under a reused string key
  apart from the previous life's rows still awaiting purge; a key that
  is never reused is the life, and the strict create refuses a key whose
  purge is pending, so lives cannot mix. What it would leave behind is
  permanent from the first row written: a second identity per tenant, a
  mint per create, and a mapping consulted on every operation, for a
  capability (in-place replacement) the design rejects.
  `open_or_create_partition` goes.
- The partition handle goes: every data operation takes the key, and
  the registry read that fences it returns the codec configuration.
  Codec objects are cached process-wide by configuration, not per key.
- `purge_partition(key) -> DONE | MORE`: purges this key's dead rows,
  bounded per call; `DONE` when no garbage remains under the key. On
  SQLite the DELETE waits on the write lock up to the driver's busy
  timeout and raises past it; the reconciler retries.
- `purge_deleted_partitions()`: kept for library users without a tenant
  service; the server does not run it.

### Vector store

The collection registry leaves the vector backend and becomes the
store's rows in the key registry, which is the record of every key that
ever carried a record and what makes every record purgeable on a
backend that cannot list or reject keys.

- Native containers are deployment configuration: one per embedder
  provider per vector store, created by the schema command, never by a
  request. A container's dimensions and metric are the embedder's; its
  indexed properties are the store's, one schema for every container
  (#1573, #1572). A container is retired by the schema command when
  the configuration no longer declares its embedder and no registry row
  references it; `memmachine schema status` shows, per container, the
  registry rows referencing it by state, which is how an operator sees
  an old embedder's container drain. Until then it stays and serves the
  tenants pinned to it. Inside a container a tenant is a value or a
  native tenant object, per the table below.
- `create_collection(key, container)`: strict (see "Create is strict").
  Where the tenant is a value inside the container, one registry insert
  straight to `live`. Where the tenant is a native object (a Chroma
  collection, a Weaviate tenant), the row is inserted as `creating`,
  the object is created, and the row is set `live` with its address; a
  crash between the two leaves `creating`, which `provision` resumes by
  creating the object if absent and setting `live`. Telling "already
  exists" from other failures is per backend; on Chroma it is by
  message, since its duplicate-create error is untyped (`InternalError`
  500 locally, `ChromaError` 400 over HTTP, never the
  `UniqueConstraintError` the module exports; chromadb 1.5.9).
- Write (`upsert(key, records)`, `delete(key, ids)`): a record carrying
  an undeclared property key is rejected before anything is sent. Read
  the row for the container and address; perform the remote write,
  acknowledged as applied; read the row again and raise the not-live
  error if the key is not live. No row before the write: the not-live
  error, and no write creates a collection.
- Read (`query(key, vectors, limit, filter, allowed_ids)`,
  `get_cosine_similarity(key, vector, ids)`): read the row for the
  address, query, read the row again, raise the not-live error if the
  key is not live. `filter` names declared keys only and raises on any
  other; it is evaluated during the search where the backend can.
  `allowed_ids` restricts the search to given records; queries return
  record ids and scores, never properties.
- `delete_collection(key)`: set `dropping`. O(1), idempotent, waits for
  nothing.
- `purge_collection(key) -> DONE | MORE`: with a `dropping` row,
  delete records under the key in bounded steps by the backend's means
  in the table below, `MORE` while records remain, and remove the row
  when nothing remains. With no row, delete by key in every container
  the store has, which is how the tenant service's tombstone pass
  reaches a record that landed after the row went; `DONE` when nothing
  is found. Containers are few (one per embedder), so a no-row purge
  is a bounded number of filter deletes that mostly find nothing.

Why nothing escapes. Every record carries a key whose registry row
existed before the record could, because a write reads the row first
and no write creates a row. A completed write is checked after it lands
and raises if the key died meanwhile. A write whose check never ran
lies under a key that is `dropping`, purged by the sweep, or gone,
purged again by a sweep the tombstone pass reset, through the no-row path. No
rejection compares timestamps, and no key is forgotten while a record
under it could exist: the tombstone outlives the last possible stale
write by the retention margin under "Tenant registry".

Backends at the tier that scales to the stated tenant counts. "Addressed
by" is what an operation needs beyond the shared client, all of it held
in the registry row or equal to the key; no backend requires an object
opened per tenant and kept across operations.

| Backend | Tenant inside the container | Addressed by | Rejects a write to a dead tenant | Lists tenants | Purge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qdrant | payload value (#1564) | container name; the key as the payload filter | no | no (`facet` is approximate) | filter delete |
| Milvus | partition-key value | container name, loaded once; the key as the partition-key value | no | no | filter delete |
| pgvector | column value | table name; the key as the column value | yes, in-statement (registry in the same database) | yes | keyed delete |
| Pinecone | namespace, a call parameter; created implicitly on first upsert | index host; the key as `namespace` | no | yes | delete all in the namespace, O(1) |
| S3 Vectors | filterable metadata value (10,000 indexes per bucket, so not one per tenant) | bucket and index names; the key as the metadata filter (`$eq`; filters are evaluated during the search) | no | no | no delete by filter: filtered query (top-K up to 10,000), `DeleteVectors` by key (500 per call), repeat |
| Weaviate | native tenant, one shard each, activity tiers | collection name; the key as the tenant name (the client's `with_tenant` wrapper is built per call, no request) | yes (tenant not found) | yes | remove tenant, O(1) |
| Chroma | collection per tenant (Chroma's own write-up warns that metadata filtering "can become slow" as users and documents grow) | the collection's UUID, recorded in the registry row at creation; operations go to the HTTP API by that UUID | yes: operations route by the UUID, and a stale one raises `NotFoundError` instead of reaching a replacement (chromadb 1.5.9) | yes (`list_collections`, paged) | `delete_collection`, O(1) |
| sqlite-vec | partition-key value in one `vec0` table per container | table name; the key as the partition key | yes, in-statement (registry in the same file) | yes | keyed delete |
| usearch store | rows in a shared table; one index file per tenant | table name; the key as the column value; the index file path | yes, in-statement (registry in the same file) | yes | keyed delete; unlink the file |

Pinecone's implicit namespace creation and any backend's inability to
reject are covered the same way: the registry row exists before the
first record, and purge deletes by the tenant's value. Chroma's Python
client only offers a `Collection` object obtained by `get_collection`,
one round trip resolving a name to the collection's UUID, after which
every operation addresses the UUID (`chromadb/api/fastapi.py`). The
store records that UUID in the registry row at creation and calls the
HTTP API by it, so no operation makes the lookup and no object is
held. Where a client library only offers per-tenant objects, the store
uses the backend's HTTP API directly, as here, or builds the object per
call where that is free, as for Weaviate. Verified against chromadb
1.5.9 (comment on #1579): a stale UUID raises `NotFoundError` rather
than writing into a replacement, so the UUID is the fence on this
backend; eight clients racing `create_collection` on one name produce
one winner every round, the constraint living in the persisted sysdb;
metadata values must be scalars, which the only thing stored on a
collection, its container reference, is. The per-collection cost on a
single Chroma node (an index each) and the collection count Chroma
Cloud supports remain unverified and are checked before an
implementation. S3 Vectors' limits are from its documentation as of
this writing: filterable metadata is 2 KB per vector, and timestamps
must be stored as numbers to be range-filtered, since comparisons apply
to numbers only.

The SQLite stores. Both are rewritten away from a table per collection,
like the segment store: the sqlite-vec store keeps one `vec0` table per
container with the tenant key as its partition key, the usearch store
keeps records in one shared table and one index file per tenant (a file
it owns, not schema; index state lives in process memory, which is why
it stays at `process` scope), and both keep their registry in the same
file, so their fence is in-statement and the sqlite-vec store reaches
`host` scope. The O(1) drop that a table per collection gave becomes a
keyed delete run by the purge job, as in the segment store;
unreachability is immediate through the registry either way. A `vec0`
partition key is not a filter over a shared scan: vec0 stores each
partition value's vectors in chunks of its own, and a KNN constrained on
the key reads only those chunks. Measured on the pinned 0.1.9 with 400
tenants of 25 vectors each at 1024 dimensions, the constrained query
cost two orders of magnitude less than an unconstrained one over the
same table. The cost of a partition is the chunk allocation: every
partition value holds at least one chunk of `chunk_size` vectors,
`chunk_size` times dimensions times four bytes, which a table per
collection paid identically (measured: the same size per tenant either
way). `chunk_size` is a per-table setting the store exposes, and a
deployment with many small tenants sets it low.
`sqlite_vec_vector_store.py:4` records that partition keys were avoided
in case a future sqlite-vec ANN index does not support them; if that
comes to pass, the store stays brute-force, which is what it is today
and what its scope is for.

## Composition and settings

Four rules, then the mechanics.

1. Fixed topology, pluggable slots. The standard server is a fixed graph
   of roles: database engines, the key registry, the event store, the
   segment store, the vector store, embedders, rerankers, language
   models, the episodic memory manager, the ingest service, the tenant
   service, the routers. Each role is an ABC. The graph never varies
   between deployments; what fills each slot does. This is the shape of
   every server that supports many backends from one image (a database
   `ENGINE` setting, SQLAlchemy dialects, the OpenTelemetry Collector's
   receivers and exporters, an AI gateway's model list).
2. Composition is Python. One function, `compose(settings) -> Server`,
   constructs every resource by calling constructors and factories with
   the objects they depend on. Wiring order is evaluation order; a wrong
   argument is a type error the type checker reports before anything
   runs; a library user's own class needs nothing but an import. The
   server ships the standard composition, which `memmachine serve`
   runs; `memmachine serve --compose my_package.wiring:compose` runs
   another. A deployment that needs a different graph writes Python,
   which is what a wiring file would have been describing anyway.
3. Settings are data. Everything a deployment sets without changing the
   graph: which kind fills each slot and that kind's own values (URLs,
   credentials, pool sizes, pragmas, model names, dimensions), plus
   bind address, roles, scope, reconciler intervals, property and
   filter bounds, and the tenant templates. Read from environment
   variables and an optional YAML or TOML file of the same shape,
   validated at startup against Pydantic settings models, with a JSON
   Schema and a documented example generated from them. Secrets are
   environment variables. A settings file carries no wiring; it cannot
   express a graph.
4. Scoped views. A dependency that could be misused across a boundary
   is scoped before it is injected, so the misuse is unrepresentable
   rather than checked: the key registry is handed to a store as a view
   over that store's rows only; the vector store is handed to an
   episodic memory object as a view over one container only. A store
   cannot touch another store's rows, and an object built for one
   embedder cannot write into another embedder's container. The rule
   applies wherever a shared resource serves several holders.
5. Three scopes, three kinds of object, told apart by identity. A
   resource is built by the composition, has identity and a lifecycle,
   and holds connections or bounds the deployment: stores, the key
   registry, the providers that exist. A configured object is built by
   a factory from resources and a tenant's structural configuration, is
   interchangeable with any other built from the same configuration, is
   cached by configuration and never by tenant, and has no lifecycle:
   an `EpisodicMemory` bound to an embedder, a container-scoped view. A
   call argument belongs to one request. Factories are resources and
   their products are not; a factory is the resource that stands in for
   a family of configured objects, which is the metrics factory's model
   already. An option is classified by the same line: per server if it
   holds identity or bounds the deployment; per tenant and structural
   if it decides where or how records are written; per tenant and a
   default if it only shapes answers but a caller wants one setting for
   all its calls; per request if it may vary per call. The separation
   is enforced by signature, not by convention: a structural option is
   a constructor parameter of the configured object and a parameter of
   no operation; a per-request option is a parameter of the operation
   and of no constructor; a tenant default is a field of the tenant
   configuration model whose name is an operation parameter, checked at
   import time, and the manager fills it into the call. An option
   cannot exist in two places, so it cannot silently change scope.

Kinds. Each slot family has one table from kind name to callable, a
class or a factory, and the slot's settings type is a discriminated
union over the registered kinds, keyed by `kind`, so validation and
schema generation cover plugins. Built-in kinds register by being
imported; out-of-tree kinds register through `importlib.metadata`
entry points, one group per family (`memmachine.engines`,
`memmachine.vector_stores`, `memmachine.embedders`, ...), which is
Python's standard plugin mechanism and keeps the core ignorant of
backends it did not ship. Heavy client libraries are optional extras
imported inside the kind's factory, so a deployment that never selects
Milvus never imports it; one image carries every built-in kind.

Why not YAML for wiring. A wiring document is Python written in YAML,
with a loader to turn it back: a registry of ids, reference resolution,
topological ordering and runtime type checks, all to avoid a file the
type checker and the interpreter already handle. The usual reasons for a
separate wiring file do not apply here: nothing is reloaded, and
arbitrary code execution is not a new exposure, since the composition
runs as the server's own code at the trust of the image. What YAML is
good at, values templated by Helm or set from a ConfigMap and the
environment, is exactly what settings are.

Why not Python for settings. Values change per environment without a
code change, are templated by deployment tooling, and must be validated
and documented as data. A URL in a Python file is a URL that needs a
code review to change.

Where the standard composition is data-driven: at every slot, through
the kind tables, and in how many providers exist, since embedders,
rerankers and language models are named settings entries and the
composition instantiates one object per entry. The standard composition
decides the graph; settings decide what fills it and how many of each
provider there are.

The standard composition, sketched:

```python
def compose(s: ServerSettings) -> Server:
    main = ENGINES[s.databases.main.kind](s.databases.main)
    embedders = {name: EMBEDDERS[e.kind](e) for name, e in s.embedders.items()}
    rerankers = {name: RERANKERS[r.kind](r) for name, r in s.rerankers.items()}
    registry = SqlKeyRegistry(main)
    events = SqlAlchemyEventStore(main, s.event_store)
    segments = SqlAlchemySegmentStore(main, s.segment_store)
    vector_store = VECTOR_STORES[s.vector_store.kind](
        registry.scoped("vector-store"), s.vector_store
    )
    episodic = EpisodicMemoryManager(
        events, segments, vector_store, embedders, rerankers,
        s.episodic_memory,
    )
    tenants = TenantService(
        main, components=[events, episodic], templates=s.tenant_templates
    )
    return Server(
        tenants, IngestService(events, [episodic]), [episodic], s.server
    )
```

The settings a deployment writes, each key a field of a settings model:

```yaml
databases:
  main:
    kind: postgres
    url: ${MEMMACHINE_DATABASE_URL}
vector_store:
  kind: qdrant
  url: http://qdrant:6333
  indexed_properties:      # once per store; system fields implicit
    kind: string
    score: integer
embedders:
  openai-large:
    kind: openai
    model: text-embedding-3-large
    dimensions: 1024
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
rerankers:
  bm25:
    kind: bm25
tenant_templates:          # data: copied into new tenants, never built
  default:
    episodic_memory:
      embedder: openai-large
      reranker: bm25
      search:
        limit: 10
        expand_context: 4
server:
  bind: 0.0.0.0:8080
  concurrency_scope: cluster
  roles: [api, reconciler]
```

Tenant templates are validated at startup against each component's
tenant configuration model, including their provider ids against the
providers the composition built, and nothing is built from them. A
template edit changes future tenants only; existing tenants keep their
recorded configuration, which an operator changes with `PATCH`.

Provider ids are stable identities. A provider's model or dimensions
are not changed under an id; a new model is a new id. Removing an id
from the settings fails startup while any tenant of that component
references it, which the component checks from its own per-tenant table
at construction.

Routing stores. A slot may be filled by an implementation that routes
over several children of the same ABC, placing each key on one child
and recording the choice in its own key registry row's address; every
later operation reads that row, as the fence already does, and
dispatches. No new key is passed anywhere: the tenant id is the key,
and placement is server-side state. That is how tenants are placed
across several vector clusters once one is full, and how a tenant moves
between backends; it does not conflict with "no sharding", which is
about process ownership, not data placement. Not in the first
deployment; a custom composition wires it when needed.

The earlier `resource_initializer.py` proposal (edwinyyyu/MemMachine,
e134c531) is superseded rather than improved: its three problems,
custom logic per builder, no dynamic registration, and stringly typed
dependencies, dissolve when there is no builder layer, because the
constructor is the builder, a class is available by being imported, and
a dependency is a typed parameter.

## Startup and wiring

`memmachine serve [--compose MODULE:FUNCTION]` reads the settings, runs
the composition, verifies schema and scope, then starts the roles.
Startup fails on the first constructor that raises, naming the resource
and the cause, before the socket is bound. Shutdown runs in reverse:
routers stop accepting, a reconciler finishes its current job,
resources close.

Nothing per tenant is created after startup: a request reads rows and
calls stores with the tenant id, and a process holds no per-tenant
state beyond a store's private cache where a backend needs one.

## Server API

Prefix `/v1`. Tenant ids in paths are UUIDs; names are looked up
explicitly. Bodies are JSON. `?wait=` on the three lifecycle requests
blocks until the change has applied or the wait elapses.

Tenants:

| Method and path | Effect | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/tenants` | create; body `name`, `template`, `config` | 202 provisioning, or 201 with `wait` once active; 409 `tenant_exists`; 422 |
| `GET /v1/tenants?name=` | look up by name | 200; 404 |
| `GET /v1/tenants?prefix=&cursor=` | list, paged | 200 |
| `GET /v1/tenants/{id}` | record, state, requested and applied configuration versions, jobs with attempts and last error | 200; 404 |
| `PATCH /v1/tenants/{id}` | rename and/or configuration update | 202, or 200 with `wait` once applied; 409; 422 |
| `DELETE /v1/tenants/{id}` | start deletion | 202, or 204 with `wait` once deleted; 404 |

Events, under `/v1/tenants/{id}`:

| Method and path | Effect | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST .../events` | ingest a batch | 202 with stored ids, skipped ids and the last position, or 200 with `wait` once every subsystem has processed it; 404; 409; 422 |
| `GET .../events/{event_id}` | one event | 200; 404 |
| `GET .../events?filter=&cursor=` | list events | 200 |
| `POST .../events/delete` | body `ids` | 202, or 200 with `wait` |

Episodic memory, under `/v1/tenants/{id}/episodic-memory`:

| Method and path | Effect | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST .../search` | body `query`, `limit`, `since`, `before`, `source_ids`, `filter` (JSON tree), `expand_context`, `include_events`, `reranker` (an offered id; the tenant's default if absent) | 200 with up to `limit` scored hits |
| `POST .../expand` | body `anchor` (segment or event uuid), `before`, `after`, `unit` (`segments` or `events`), `source_ids` | 200 with the ordered neighbourhood and cursors |
| `GET ...` | watermark and lag behind the event store | 200 |

Event body: `id` (optional UUID), `timestamp` (optional; server time if
absent), `source_id` (optional string), `context` (an object of parts keyed by
kind, for example `{"author": {"name": "Alice"}}`), `blocks` (list of `{type: text,
text}`), `properties` (scalar values under legal keys; what `filter`
sees).
Search hit: `score`, `segments` (each with `event_id`, `index`,
`timestamp`, `source_id`, `context`, `text`, `properties`) and, with
`include_events`, the events.

Errors: one handler for the domain error hierarchy maps to a status and
a body `{error: {code, message}}` with a closed set of codes:
`tenant_not_found`, `tenant_not_active`, `tenant_exists`,
`invalid_request`, `provider_unavailable`, `internal`. No traceback
leaves the process. Everything unmapped is 500 `internal` with the
traceback logged. Every request is answered; no path drops the
connection.

MCP: rebuilt over the same component objects, with the tenant id taken
from a header; not designed here.

Clients: the Python and TypeScript clients are generated from the OpenAPI
document, not mirrored by hand.

## Schema management

Two kinds of schema:

1. Component schema: the tenant registry tables, each store's registry
   and data tables, the key registry, each component's per-tenant
   table, and the native containers of the vector backends. Static,
   versioned, migrated by an operator's command.
2. Per-tenant resources: rows, in every store. Tenant-specific DDL is
   the only DDL allowed outside `memmachine schema upgrade`, and no
   store in this design uses it; the usearch store's index file per
   tenant is a file, not schema.

Component schema:

- Each SQL-backed component owns an Alembic script directory beside its
  code and its own version table (`schema_version_<component>`), so a
  library user composing some components migrates only those.
  Migrations are written from Alembic autogenerate diffs against the
  component's metadata; the metadata is never applied with
  `create_all`.
- Each vector store owns `provision_containers()`, which
  idempotently creates the containers its configuration declares.
- `memmachine schema upgrade --settings PATH` is the only thing that runs
  component DDL: per configured database, under
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on PostgreSQL or `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` on SQLite,
  it upgrades every component assigned to that database to head, then
  provisions containers. Initial setup is an upgrade from an empty
  database; there is no separate path. It runs from a deploy job, an
  init container, or a shell before `serve`.
- `memmachine serve` verifies at startup that every component's version
  table is at the head its code carries and fails otherwise, naming the
  component and both versions. `memmachine schema status --settings PATH`
  prints the same comparison, the per-container registry counts, and
  the tombstone count by state (awaiting a clean sweep, within
  retention).
- Rolling deployments: a migration must keep the previous release's
  code working (expand and contract: add before the code that reads,
  remove after the code that writes is gone), because during a rollout
  processes of both releases run against one schema. A migration that
  cannot is a release note that requires a stop.

## What is reused and what is removed

Reused, with the change named:

- `episodic_memory/event_memory/`: `EventMemory` renamed to episodic
  memory, the segmenters, the derivers, the data types, and the segment
  store (UUID keys in place of incarnations, `purge_partition`, no
  handle).
- `common/vector_store/`: the four implementations, with the registry
  replaced by rows in the key registry checked after each operation,
  the `config` parameter removed from `create_collection`, containers
  provisioned by the schema command, and the two SQLite stores on
  shared tables.
- `common/filter/`: the filter expression tree, as the closed union on
  the reference branch; the string parser goes.
- `common/embedder/`, `common/language_model/`, `common/reranker/`,
  each class taking its settings model in its constructor in place of
  the separate configuration model.
- `common/metrics_factory/`, `common/payload_codec/`.
- `enable_sqlite_foreign_keys` and the engine construction in
  `common/resource_manager/database_manager.py`, as the `sqlite` and
  `postgres` factory kinds.

New: the event store, the key registry, the ingest service, the tenant
service and reconciler, the standard composition and the settings
models, the schema command, the routers.

Removed: `main/memmachine.py`; `episodic_memory/episodic_memory.py`,
`episodic_memory_manager.py`, `instance_lru_cache.py`,
`long_term_memory/`, `declarative_memory/`, `short_term_memory/`;
`common/session_manager/`, `common/episode_store/`,
`common/vector_graph_store/`, `common/neo4j_utils.py`;
`common/resource_manager/` (the managers, the locator functions, the
`CommonResourceManager` protocol); `common/configuration/`;
`common/filter/filter_parser.py`; `server/api_v2/` including the config
router and the traceback-carrying error model; `semantic_memory/`;
`retrieval_agent/`; `installation/`; `memmachine_common/api/spec.py`.

Migration from the current server, should a cutover happen with data in
place, moves no segment row and no vector record. The current server's
store key is already the first 32 hex characters of the SHA-256 of the
session string (`partition_key_for_session`), which parses as a UUID,
and the same value names the vector collection; a legacy tenant's id is
set to that value, and every store finds its data under it. New tenants
mint `uuid4`; the two coexist in one column, and the collision math is
unaffected. What remains proportional to records is the backfill of a
tenant's events from `episodestore` into the event store with
positions, a per-tenant job bounded per pass like every other. Nothing
is re-embedded. This is why the tenant id is the physical key in every
store rather than a registry-minted identity behind it: the one thing
such an indirection would buy, adopting data keyed some other way, is
not needed, and it would cost a mint per create, a second identity per
store, and a mapping row that outlives purging.

## What must be built first

The first deployment of this design carries no data forward, so nothing
is urgent because existing data would be expensive to change. What is
urgent is what the first deployment freezes: anything written into
stored records, and anything a client integrates against. Those parts
must be in place before the first tenant is created, whatever else is
still partial. Everything else can follow without touching a record or
a client.

In the first deployment, because the first records freeze it:

1. The tenant id as the store key, minted per life, and the tenant table
   with its tombstones, with create, delete and status recorded there.
   A key scheme written into every record cannot be changed later on
   backends that cannot rename; the reconciler that executes deletions
   may land after, but the rows and jobs it needs must exist before the
   first delete. This includes the key being the physical key inside
   each store's own tables: the segment store's rows keyed by the
   tenant id with no incarnation column, because a store's schema is
   permanent from its first row, and a store-private identity written
   then could never be removed.
2. The event store as the system of record, with positions. Derived
   data written without it can never be reprocessed or handed to a
   subsystem added later, because no other copy of the events exists in
   this server.
3. What goes into stored records: system fields under the reserved
   `memmachine_` keys, scalar-only bounded properties, the declared
   index schema per vector store, and containers per embedder. Every
   vector payload and segment row written freezes them, and most
   backends cannot rewrite a payload key in place.
4. A registry row for every vector key, with strict create and the check
   after each operation. The row is what makes a key's garbage
   addressable at all; purging and the tombstone pass can follow,
   but a key that was never registered can never be purged.
5. The public surface: the v1 API, the event shape, the filter as a JSON
   tree, limits as maximums, one error handler. Clients freeze it, and
   changing it later is a client migration.
6. Alembic from the first migration, which is the schema itself. Free at
   the start and painful once `create_all` has run anywhere.

Before churn, not before the first byte: the reconciler role executing
durable deletions, sweeps and replays, and the tombstone pass. None
writes anything into records, and a deployment with few deletions can
run with them recorded as jobs until it lands. "No implicit creation"
is not a task in a new server; there is no path to remove.

At any time: the generated settings schema and example, the
concurrency scope check, generated clients, the SQLite stores on shared
tables, MCP. Internal or reversible.

The first deployment's minimum is therefore narrower than this
document: the tenant table and jobs, the event store, episodic memory
over the shipped segment store and one registry-backed vector store, the
property conventions, the v1 API for tenants, events and search, and
Alembic. Everything else is additive, and the risk to guard against is a
partial implementation that starts writing records before one of the
six items above is in place.

## Component specifications

One specification per component, under `design/components/`, each with
its API, storage, fencing, settings, and the changes it requires of an
existing component: `README.md` (conventions), `tenant_service.md`
(registry, jobs, reconciler, sweep), `key_registry.md`,
`event_store.md`, `segment_store.md`, `vector_store.md`,

## Relation to open issues

- #1574: this document is the target for every row.
- #1548: kept; UUID keys replace incarnations, `purge_partition` is
  added, the partition handle gives way to key-parameterized
  operations, and `open_or_create_partition` goes.
- #1530: agrees on the outcome, the store ABCs keeping only the strict
  create, and on the reason: only the caller knows why an existing row
  is acceptable. The two prove different things at the same signature.
  #1530's names are reused by design and successive lives are separated
  by incarnations, so its create raising means "this exists"; here keys
  are never reused, the tenant service's tombstone enforces it, and a
  row under a key in a store is evidence of an interrupted attempt or
  a library caller's reuse.
- #1531: the reference for the concurrency scope idea. The levels,
  the declarations and the deployment-side check above are this
  design's own; they differ from #1531 where the key registry changes
  what a store can promise (Qdrant, Milvus and sqlite-vec widen).
- #1571: the router's 404/409 mapping under "Component contract"; with
  no handles there is nothing to evict.
- #1575, #1576, #1577: resolved by construction: declared components, no
  implicit creation, durable jobs with retry.
- #1572, #1573, #1564, #1565, #1537, #1563: the vector store contract
  above: containers from configuration, the key registry as the record
  of every key, checks after each operation, tenants as values,
  single-use keys, purging plus the tenant service's tombstone
  sweep. In-flight registry PRs are measured against that section.
- #1535: one declared, typed `indexed_properties` schema per vector
  store, in configuration, under "Properties and filtering".
- #1570: "Schema management".
- #1542: SQLite pragmas become fields of the SQLite engine's settings
  (`busy_timeout`, `journal_mode`); the reconciler's retry covers the
  busy-timeout raise.

## Open questions

- Hierarchy: flat tenants with prefix listing, proposed, or a parent
  column with cascading delete as jobs.
- Event size limits, and block types beyond text (the data types admit
  others).
- Readable metadata as a `json` block type, or a designed field.
- Retention: deleting events by age or by source, as a job kind.
